capital.n | 0 | Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working %% capital %% by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . `` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , the bill 's chief sponsor .

'' By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. Karatz said . The company is putting up only 10 % of the %% capital %% , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture . `` This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' Mr. Karatz said .

capital.n | 0 | Some think Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence . The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say . Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some %% capital %% -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say . It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders . But `` the concept is workable .
capital.n | 0 | But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash . In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill . Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of %% capital %% , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P . A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried . `` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .

capital.n | 0 | To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank %% capital %% for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .
capital.n | 0 | `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude %% capital %% gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . ''

The FDIC , which in 1986 provided $ 130 million in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma 's Bank of Oklahoma , Tulsa , unit will continue to maintain $ 90 million in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit . In exchange for the other $ 40 million , the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60 % of BancOklahoma 's common stock outstanding , up from the 55 % option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 %% capital %% infusion . In exchange for the $ 76 million they are owed , creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers , the bank holding company said . Also under the agreement , debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma 's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own , the company said .

Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million . Gains from First Chicago 's venture %% capital %% unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ 25.7 million a year ago . Interest income and most fee income was strong .

Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested %% capital %% , '' he says . Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied . He also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared .
capital.n | 0 | In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago . The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger %% capital %% positions . ( Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . )

By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion . Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly , but that was largely because %% capital %% gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments . Property\/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters , as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments .
capital.n | 0 | This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says . Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move %% capital %% into the highest-quality securities they could find . But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .
capital.n | 0 | NCNB Texas National , formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter . NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 . NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new %% capital %% during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise . Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million . In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier .
capital.n | 0 | Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it did n't make a $ 1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ 23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures . The radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working %% capital %% from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions . It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt . In September , the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business .
capital.n | 0 | It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies . Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian %% capital %% . Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe . `` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .
capital.n | 0 | The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals . The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad . `` There are really very few companies that have adequate %% capital %% to buy properties in a raw state for cash . Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind . `` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
capital.n | 0 | Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the %% capital %% . But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills . The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation .
capital.n | 0 | The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a %% capital %% gains cut . There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery .
capital.n | 0 | Dresdner Bank AG of West Germany has announced a friendly tender offer for control of Banque Internationale de Placements , a French bank whose main shareholder is France 's Societe Generale , the Societe de Bourses Francaises said . The tender offer by West Germany 's second-biggest commercial bank is in two stages . Dresdner is offering to acquire 32.99 % of BIP 's %% capital %% for 1,015 francs ( $ 156.82 ) a share . The terms of the offer put a value of 528 million francs ( $ 81.6 million ) on the 32.99 % shareholding . The Societe Generale banking group controls 18.2 % of the shareholding , while Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. owns 9.69 % and Financiere Tradition , a holding company , owns 5.1 % .
capital.n | 0 | The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives . Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right . Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's %% capital %% should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week . In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch . Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
capital.n | 0 | The stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading . But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating %% capital %% . In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 . Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .

Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up %% capital %% to expand its insurance business . But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing . Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .

The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ 107.8 million on sales of $ 435.5 million . Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy %% capital %% investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . The company , based in Wilmington , Del. , is 81%-owned by Montedison S.p . A. , Milan , which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares it does n't already own . At Quantum Chemical Corp. , New York , the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion .

The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies . Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for %% capital %% improvements . And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year .
capital.n | 0 | The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 . Let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure . According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million %% capital %% , `` follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young , high-flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy . But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... '' You need n't be a high-powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
capital.n | 0 | The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $ 1 each . The offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged . BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its %% capital %% and increase shareholder value . If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , BSN will increase its debt by $ 9 million , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt , said Michael J. Blumenfeld , president . `` We have sufficient cash flow to handle that , '' he said .
capital.n | 0 | Net income surged 31 % to 7.63 billion yen from 5.82 billion yen . Per-share net rose to 7.84 yen from 6.53 yen . Brisk domestic demand due to increasing %% capital %% investment pushed up sales sharply in construction and industrial machinery divisions . Domestic sales of construction machinery , such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen . Demand from Europe and Southeast Asia also grew , but due to increasing production at local plants , overseas sales edged down 2.8 % .
capital.n | 0 | The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar . A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. . That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign %% capital %% to the U.S. . Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting . In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % .
capital.n | 0 | Today , about $ 200 billion , or 20 % of all pension-fund stock investments , is held by index funds . The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms . These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30 % to 40 % a year on their %% capital %% , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks . The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell . And they believe the Big Board , under Mr. Phelan , has abandoned their interest .
capital.n | 0 | But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year . '' White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . `` We do n't need this as a way to get %% capital %% gains , '' he said . House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . '' The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .
capital.n | 0 | Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's ( temporary ? ) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax . As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write . What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt %% capital %% is drying up . Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing . Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
capital.n | 0 | The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt . Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the %% capital %% gains tax cut . The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month .

capital.n | 0 | It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components . The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign %% capital %% . He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
capital.n | 0 | Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit . If government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets ( limits on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. ) , the end loser will be the markets themselves . Instead , we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer %% capital %% among all participants .

Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and %% capital %% adjustments . Without detailing specific product breakdowns , Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales -- including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems -- to surging `` leisure-oriented '' sales in foreign markets . Export sales for leisure items alone , for instance , totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months , up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year .
capital.n | 0 | There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery . For one thing , no one doubts that the %% capital %% gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote . Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco .
capital.n | 0 | Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business . But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash . In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of %% capital %% is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .

exchange.n | 0 | To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . It 's time for the %% exchanges %% and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .

The FDIC , which in 1986 provided $ 130 million in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma 's Bank of Oklahoma , Tulsa , unit will continue to maintain $ 90 million in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit . In %% exchange %% for the other $ 40 million , the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60 % of BancOklahoma 's common stock outstanding , up from the 55 % option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion .

exchange.n | 0 | Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York ? Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade . In a competitive market , this investor has many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives ( both foreign and domestic ) if his volume is profitable for an %% exchange %% to handle . If not Chicago , then in New York ; if not the U.S. , then overseas . Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .

By the market 's close , volume on the New York %% exchange %% totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record . The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 . But the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy .
exchange.n | 0 | Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares . The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding . The %% exchange %% ratio was never established . Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock .

The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .

exchange.n | 0 | Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout . European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound . The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York %% exchanges %% opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping 12.8 % . In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % . West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .
exchange.n | 0 | Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace . The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it . On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures %% exchanges %% . These are the main proponents of program trading . Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .
exchange.n | 0 | Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months . Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said . Program trades make up 10 % of the %% exchange %% 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said .

But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among %% exchanges %% . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .

In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading .

exchange.n | 0 | The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected %% exchanges %% acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .

exchange.n | 0 | The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake . Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street . '' Big Board stock specialists , in a bold palace revolt , began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the %% exchange %% to ban program trading .

The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock %% exchange %% -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives . Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs .

The %% exchange %% said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .

Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night 's sleep was considered poisonous ; ; wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .

It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or %% removed %% from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .

Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight . This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .

feel.v | 0 | The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , %% feel %% personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .

Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he %% felt %% about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; ; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself .

Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner . Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom %% feel %% betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate . For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis . Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .

But the famous orator %% felt %% more than vague recognition for the scene . He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .

Immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` I do n't %% feel %% like talking right now '' . Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refers to the woman 's husband .

In New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : `` I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and %% felt %% joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man '' . Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey 's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana . She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately .

feel.v | 0 | In fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons . Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to %% feel %% in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive .

I do n't %% feel %% much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' . A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' .

The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively %% feels %% emotions . Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .

The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but Lizzie 's expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet .

That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he %% feels %% , not to anyone else ) .

feel.v | 0 | Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training . Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts . In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always %% felt %% -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words . At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists . Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .

If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she %% feels %% age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .

Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan %% area %% , and a new regional airport . When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?

Denver is another metropolitan %% area %% where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .

Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan %% areas %% will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing %% areas %% , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .

turn.v | 0 | Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers . Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson 's Bay Company 's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson 's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall . He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who %% turned %% their eyes toward the United States . Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise .

turn.v | 0 | The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact %% turning %% the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy . And this may be as far as the process will go . The Kremlin 's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office .
turn.v | 0 | Rudyard Kipling 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention %% turned %% to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .

Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might %% turn %% in the future . He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights .

For example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- %% turned %% up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .

turn.v | 0 | You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables were %% turned %% , and we were in the Soviets ' position : `` There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean .

turn.v | 0 | Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .

Again , by spreading one 's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad . This is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France 's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather %% turn %% a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas . A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ; ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district . These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis .

Nor have we %% remembered %% that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .

Harry fondly %% remembers %% the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong . `` An L.A. solution , '' explains Mr. Friedman . Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it .
remember.v | 0 | This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act . The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation . This is obvious when it is %% remembered %% that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .
president.n | 0 | But Intel later succumbed to the stock market 's plunge , closing at $ 31.75 , down $ 2.125 . In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new 80486 chip in the current quarter . On Friday , Andrew S.Grove , Intel %% president %% and chief executive officer , said `` Intel 's business is strong . Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good . For the full quarter , our bookings were higher than the previous quarter , and our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.0 . ''
president.n | 0 | Where 's the guy who can say : ` Enough is enough ' '' ? The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes . `` I 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , '' said Kenneth Olsen , Digital Equipment Corp. %% president %% , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 . `` I did n't bother calling anybody ; I did n't even turn on TV . '' `` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added John Smale , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 .
president.n | 0 | What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo . President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the %% president %% , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .
president.n | 0 | Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge , N.J. , said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit . `` There is no pressing need to sell the unit , but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business , renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad , '' said William Slider , Hertz 's executive vice %% president %% . `` We are only going to sell at the right price . '' Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $ 90 million on revenue of $ 150 million in 1988 .
president.n | 0 | Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million . It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska . Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's %% president %% and chief executive officer . He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
president.n | 0 | Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure . A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case . But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the %% president %% `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
president.n | 0 | They could still panic and bail out of the market . But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse . `` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said John W. Rogers , %% president %% of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks . Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . '' He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .
president.n | 0 | R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company . Herbert M. Baum , the 53-year-old president of the company 's Campbell U.S.A. unit , and Edwin L. Harper , 47 , the chief financial officer , will run Campbell as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named . The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates , including food-industry executives with considerable international experience .
president.n | 0 | Terms were n't disclosed . Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold . John Verret , the agency 's %% president %% and chief executive , will retain the title of president . Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area . That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .
president.n | 0 | Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone 's casting operation to supply it , he said , which will force Keystone to purchase billet , or unfinished steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year . Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of $ 8 million to $ 10 million , within the next 18 to 24 months , Mr. Simmons said . Under Robert W. Singer , who was named %% president %% and chief operating officer last year , Keystone has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West coasts . `` Prior to a year ago , Keystone was an order-taker . Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers , '' Mr. Simmons said .
president.n | 0 | That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures . The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local %% president %% , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .

Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , %% president %% of Ned Davis Research Inc . But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash . `` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says .
president.n | 0 | Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him . Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency . Fred Wertheimer -- %% president %% of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
president.n | 0 | There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the %% president %% 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
president.n | 0 | In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . '' In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . '' The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice %% president %% at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services . Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday . In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year .
president.n | 0 | Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts . Some in the industry are skeptical . `` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time %% president %% of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report . The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC .
president.n | 0 | That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . `` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , '' says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice %% president %% of Helmsley Spear Inc . He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market . Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents .
president.n | 0 | CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter . In the year-earlier period , CityFed had net income of $ 485,000 , but no per-share earnings . CityFed 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors . He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September . Approximately 85 % of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets .
president.n | 0 | For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business . Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses . Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice %% president %% , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully { will be } the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . '' To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card . Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
president.n | 0 | Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto . Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous %% presidents %% . A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure . Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
president.n | 0 | Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . '' So far , the %% president %% seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects . There 's no need for such concessions .
president.n | 0 | This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the %% president %% 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes . What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .
president.n | 0 | Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the %% president %% 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .

John P. Frank , %% president %% of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks . `` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues .

It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said . Joseph Hardiman , %% president %% of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency .

Everything will be taken over by the new company , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice %% president %% of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine . Once its ownership is finalized , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities . Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .

president.n | 0 | As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the %% president %% , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills . If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .

The government sued the company in April , seeking $ 23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract-steering scheme . The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice %% president %% Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company . The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss , an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ 23,000 in bribes , kickbacks and gratuities . Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme .
president.n | 0 | Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the %% president %% for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .

There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A.

Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , %% president %% of the prestigious Alfred A.

Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said . Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice %% president %% at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers .

Forrest , Environmental Systems %% president %% and chief executive officer , said the change increases the company 's effective tax rate to about 35 % from 20 % .
president.n | 0 | Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars ( US$ 851 million ) , in Great Britain and elsewhere . C.S. Richardson , Atco 's senior vice %% president %% , finance , said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program . `` The projects are big . They can be C$ 1 billion plus , '' Mr. Richardson said .
president.n | 0 | David A. DiLoreto , %% president %% of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August .
president.n | 0 | Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the %% president %% being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government . The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .
president.n | 0 | `` I think the resurgence { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , %% president %% of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained . Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer .
president.n | 0 | The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen %% presidents %% have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
president.n | 0 | William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank . The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 . He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , %% president %% and chief executive in March for health reasons . Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman . Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier .
president.n | 0 | Mr. Bernstein , who succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 . Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house . Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , %% president %% of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division . Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen . There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family .
president.n | 0 | It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team . `` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice %% president %% of Headline News , CNN 's sister network . But that wo n't be easy . Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change .
president.n | 0 | During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the %% president %% the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''
president.n | 0 | In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible . The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action . Says Peter Mokaba , %% president %% of the South African Youth Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . '' They never considered themselves to be anything else . At last night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
president.n | 0 | Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . '' So far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the %% president %% 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects . There 's no need for such concessions . The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
president.n | 0 | `` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues . Analysts do n't see it that way . `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , %% president %% of Professional Marketing Management Inc . Adds Bill Lempesis , senior industry analyst for DataQuest , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . ''
president.n | 0 | The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary . As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc. , a unit of Canada 's Trizec Corp . Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' %% president %% , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . '' He called today 's announcement `` opportunistic and disruptive '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
president.n | 0 | Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice %% president %% for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .
president.n | 0 | Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen , climbing 17 % from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period . Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment , unchanged . Atsushi Muramatsu , executive vice %% president %% and chief financial officer of Nissan , said , `` The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987 , when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties . `` It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set , '' he added .
president.n | 0 | But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . `` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice %% president %% of marketing . In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 . But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
president.n | 0 | Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber , 39 years old , who had been %% president %% and chief operating officer for the past year , was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain . He succeeds his father , Philip T. Wilber , who founded the company and remains chairman . Robert E. Lyons III , 39 , who headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed president and chief operating officer , succeeding Gary Wilber .
president.n | 0 | Also in Beirut , a Moslem group vowed to kill Americans if the U.S. implements a policy to seize suspects abroad . Nixon concluded five days of private talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing , but apparently failed to ease strains in Sino-U.S. ties caused by China 's crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in June . Beijing 's rulers complained to the former %% president %% about U.S. `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs . Mexico 's President Salinas said the country 's recession had ended and the economy was growing again . In his first state of the nation address , Salinas pledged to continue his program of modernization and warned opposition politicians that impeding progress could cost them popular support .
president.n | 0 | Memotec is a Montreal-based maker of telecommunications products and provider of telecommunications and computer services . Memotec said the agreement calls for it to make a $ 20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of ISI . But it said Charles Johnston , ISI chairman and %% president %% , agreed to sell his 60 % stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash , Memotec stock and debentures . Memotec said the tender offer is conditioned on , among other things , holders tendering at least 15 % of the shares outstanding , other than the shares held by Mr. Johnston . ISI said its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid .
president.n | 0 | Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , %% president %% of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .
president.n | 0 | Bush indicated there might be `` room for flexibility '' in a bill to allow federal funding of abortions for poor women who are vicitims of rape and incest . He reiterated his opposition to such funding , but expressed hope of a compromise . The %% president %% , at a news conference Friday , also renewed a call for the ouster of Panama 's Noriega . The White House said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . The administration 's policy was stated in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions .
president.n | 0 | If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . '' Frank W. Terrizzi . Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. Terrizzi , %% president %% and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati . Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills .
president.n | 0 | `` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago . `` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice %% president %% for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif . `` Those that pulled out ( of stocks ) regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends .
president.n | 0 | `` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific . Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program . `` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice %% president %% , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator . Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .
president.n | 0 | We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings . In Florida , Renee Mottram , a senior vice %% president %% at DWG , responded : `` We do n't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives .
president.n | 0 | Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary , a men 's luxury haberdashery , to Luxco Investments . Terms were n't disclosed . As Syms 's `` core business of off-price retailing grows , a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction , '' said Marcy Syms , %% president %% of the parent , in a statement . A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas . Syms operates 25 off-price apparel stores in the U.S. .
president.n | 0 | The location was disclosed as the U.S. began planning the issues to be discussed at the Dec. 2-3 tete-a-tete . Bush unveiled a package of trade initiatives to help establish `` economic alternatives to drug trafficking '' in the Andean nations of South America . The %% president %% 's plan includes a commitment to help negotiate a new international coffee agreement . Pan Am has subpoenaed several government agencies , including the CIA and FBI , to determine whether they were warned that a bomb had been planted aboard a jet that exploded over Scotland last December , killing 270 people . The airline is attempting to show that Israel and West Germany warned the U.S. about the impending attack .
president.n | 0 | T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests . The Baltimore-based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds . But most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice %% president %% . And Vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through . In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines .
president.n | 0 | Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems . Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice %% president %% of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co . But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. . Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
president.n | 0 | Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real . If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition . Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the %% president %% of the republic in March . New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles . As for Mr. Papandreou ?
president.n | 0 | William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named %% president %% and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank . The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 . He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .
president.n | 0 | To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the %% president %% on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .
president.n | 0 | It was the Libyan leader 's first trip to Egypt in 16 years . They announced a reduction in formalities for travel , but did n't show any real signs of resuming full diplomatic ties . The Egyptian %% president %% said he would visit Libya today to resume the talks . Seoul and Pyongyang reached a tentative agreement to allow visits between families on the divided Korean peninsula . Such family reunions would be the second since 1945 .
president.n | 0 | Kenneth J. Thygerson , who was named %% president %% of this thrift holding company in August , resigned , citing personal reasons . Mr. Thygerson said he had planned to travel between the job in Denver and his San Diego home , but has found the commute too difficult to continue . A new president was n't named .
president.n | 0 | The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice %% president %% , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s . At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model .
president.n | 0 | Mr. Ibbotson thinks that this week is `` going to be a roller-coaster week . '' But he also thinks it is `` a good week to consider buying . '' John Snyder , former %% president %% of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now . `` We 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says . `` We understand panics and euphoria .
president.n | 0 | The finger-pointing has already begun . `` The equity market was illiquid . Once again { the specialists } were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , '' said Christopher Pedersen , senior vice %% president %% at Twenty-First Securities Corp . Countered James Maguire , chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc. : `` It is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job . When the dollar is in a free-fall , even central banks ca n't stop it .
president.n | 0 | Alan Seelenfreund , 52 years old , was named chairman of this processor of prescription claims , succeeding Thomas W. Field Jr. , 55 , who resigned last month . Mr. Field also had been chairman of McKesson Corp. , resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy . Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice %% president %% and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles . PCS also named Rex R. Malson , 57 , executive vice president at McKesson , as a director , filling the seat vacated by Mr. Field . Messrs. Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson , which has an 86 % stake in PCS .
president.n | 0 | Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit . In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts . `` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice %% president %% , marketing planning . Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements . National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .

president.n | 0 | That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat-growing portions of Kansas , he said . The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices . `` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice %% president %% , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago . Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go .
president.n | 0 | Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . `` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , %% president %% of New York-based BMI Capital Corp . Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . It can happen before you can turn around . ''
president.n | 0 | Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high . Budget said its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level . Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice %% president %% of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to { frequent-flier programs } have significantly diminished their value . '' This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . `` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said .
president.n | 0 | President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the %% president %% could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power . However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .
president.n | 0 | CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes . CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 . `` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice %% president %% of late night entertainment in August . `` This will raise the energy level of the show . '' CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour .
president.n | 0 | If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won . If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court ( assuming it can establish standing to sue ) , President Bush might win . In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the %% president %% 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive . If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration . But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now .
president.n | 0 | Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto . Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents . A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a %% president %% to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure . Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure . A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .
president.n | 0 | Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except Mexico , resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 255 million ) . Don Bowder , senior vice %% president %% and chief accountant , said the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$ 1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt . `` It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said . The bank said about C$ 525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending Oct. 31 .
president.n | 0 | Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50 % of Regatta Sport Ltd. , a closely held apparel maker , with the assumption of $ 3 million of contingent debt . Under the terms of the contract , New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50 % of Regatta , a maker of men 's and women 's clothes sold primarily in department stores , under certain conditions . That 50 % is now held by Clifford Parker , Regatta 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , who will continue to manage Regatta 's operations under Gitano . In 1989 , Regatta will have sales `` in excess of $ 10 million '' and will show a profit , Mr. Parker said . Gitano , which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal-Mart , said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores .
president.n | 0 | It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows . `` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice %% president %% for programming . Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos . And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in .
president.n | 0 | If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival . Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold . `` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice %% president %% for pulp and paper .

president.n | 0 | The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics . Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending . Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice %% president %% , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . '' There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
president.n | 0 | `` The public did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that , '' says A. Brean Murray , chairman of Brean Murray , Foster Securities , a traditional money management firm . The program traders , on the other hand , portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry . Critics like Mr. Murray `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says J. Thomas Allen , %% president %% of Advanced Investment Management Inc. , a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage . `` Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . '' For all the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading .
president.n | 0 | The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the %% president %% asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills . If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won . If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court ( assuming it can establish standing to sue ) , President Bush might win .
president.n | 0 | Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The %% president %% could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government . The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress .
president.n | 0 | Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . '' This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress . It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the %% president %% the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution . This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional . The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . ''

He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits . During Mr. McGovern 's nine-year term as %% president %% , the company 's sales rose to $ 5.7 billion from $ 2.8 billion and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million , the statement said . Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 . `` You 've got to make the restructuring work , '' said Mr. Baum .
president.n | 0 | `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the %% president %% 's policy to include it . When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . ''
president.n | 0 | Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold . `` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper . Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin , vice %% president %% , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . '' He also is a consensus manager , insiders say . The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll .
president.n | 0 | Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the %% president %% 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .
president.n | 0 | Its plans to be acquired dashed , Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital . In all , the company hopes to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales , which will completely discharge its secured debt , the company said . In addition , the company has replaced its %% president %% and chief executive , naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns . Mr. Nichol said he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . '' Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment , Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine , Calif. , to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices .
president.n | 0 | In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion . Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry . `` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice %% president %% of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border . In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia . Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
president.n | 0 | But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the %% president %% to veto entire bills , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
president.n | 0 | Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker . Peter Otradovec , vice %% president %% for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines . Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas . Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan .
president.n | 0 | A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure . Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure . A White House spokesman said last week that the %% president %% is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case . But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
president.n | 0 | In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . `` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice %% president %% at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc . There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . `` This further confuses retailers , '' she says .

president.n | 0 | Nasdaq volume Friday totaled 167.7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year . The single-day record of 288 million shares was set on Oct. 21 , `` There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said E.E. `` Buzzy '' Geduld , %% president %% of Herzog , Heine , Geduld , a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues . Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .
president.n | 0 | If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power . However , the %% president %% does have a duty not to violate the Constitution . The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto . Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .
president.n | 0 | Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds . Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago , '' says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm . Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice %% president %% at Charles Scwhab Corp. , says Schwab customers `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks . '' Individual investors are still angry about program trading , Mr. Quackenbush says . Avner Arbel , a Cornell University finance professor , says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to `` win back the confidence of the small investor . ''
president.n | 0 | The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the %% president %% the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny .
president.n | 0 | Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth , Calif. , facility . The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine , Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid , caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system , and stored hazardous materials in leaky , unlabeled or open-top containers . Named as defendants were Roland Matthews , %% president %% , and Peter Jonas , executive vice president and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager . The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August . `` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court .

president.n | 0 | In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building . That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute . In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice %% president %% in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world . But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on . The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .
president.n | 0 | But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive . The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million . `` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony\/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice %% president %% , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine . In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin-syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises .

president.n | 0 | ORTEGA ENDED a truce with the Contras and said elections were threatened . The Nicaraguan %% president %% , citing attacks by the U.S.-backed rebels , suspended a 19-month-old cease-fire and accused Bush of `` promoting death . '' While he reaffirmed support for the country 's Feb. 25 elections , Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting . He said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels .
president.n | 0 | President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes . What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future %% presidents %% , including Democrats , to undo . President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
president.n | 0 | -- Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws . Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including American films . `` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the %% president %% of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya . The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said . Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union .
president.n | 0 | Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn . Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , %% president %% of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa . It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .
president.n | 0 | Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV . `` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice %% president %% , news gathering ( and no relation to Ted Turner ) . `` You ca n't live on that .

If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , BSN will increase its debt by $ 9 million , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt , said Michael J.

The `` social dimension '' -- worker concerns -- of the European Community 's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort `` off the rails '' if not done reasonably , says General Electric senior vice %% president %% Frank Doyle . U.S. companies wanting to expand in Europe face `` tough pressure '' from unions in nations such as West Germany , which play a big consulting role in management decisions , he says . FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also wo n't like plant relocations and needed restructuring , which means layoffs .

Relational Technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . `` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said Paul Newton , %% president %% and chief executive officer .

president.n | 0 | Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , %% president %% of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .

president.n | 0 | The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto . Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the %% president %% to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .

president.n | 0 | Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy . It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company . `` I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' Tom Baker , %% president %% of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday . `` I do n't think their customers would like it very much .

president.n | 0 | This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional . The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . '' The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the %% president %% through the ability to withhold funding . This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report . As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .

As a result , Mr. Fleckenstein says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market . David M. Jones , vice %% president %% at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. , recommends Treasury securities ( of up to five years ' maturity ) . He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors .

Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .

hope.v | 0 | Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 . For those %% hoping %% to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass . In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party . The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .

No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly %% hoping %% to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key . She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her .

Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .
hope.v | 0 | The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress . Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . Senators %% hope %% that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill . The House appears reluctant to join the senators . A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
hope.v | 0 | In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue . A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D-Mass. ) , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony-Columbia deal . '' But he said Mr. Markey %% hopes %% this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own . And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan .
hope.v | 0 | Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly %% hope %% so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''

A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I %% hope %% thease few lines find you the same '' . The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances . Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .
hope.v | 0 | The 50-50 joint venture , which may be dubbed Eurodynamics , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion ( $ 2.17 billion ) and would be among the world 's largest missile makers . After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance . The companies %% hope %% for a final agreement by year-end . The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting . In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture .
hope.v | 0 | The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines , but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9 % jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation . Also , retail sales grew 0.5 % last month . A capital-gains tax cut was removed from the Senate 's deficit reduction bill , but proponents still %% hope %% to enact the cut this year . Bush wo n't press for a capital-gains provision in the final deficit bill when House-Senate conferees meet later this week . General Motors signaled that up to five North American assembly plants may close by the mid-1990s as it tries to cut excess capacity .
hope.v | 0 | The carrots sometimes do n't make it through the winter ; ; the cabbage and squash keep until March or April . There is never enough corn , peas or strawberries . Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and %% hopes %% that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future . A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter . New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .
hope.v | 0 | In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC . She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories . CNN executives %% hope %% the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS . That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job .
hope.v | 0 | After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had %% hoped %% . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
hope.v | 0 | Lomas Financial Corp. , Dallas , said it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. to help it sell its leasing unit . Lomas , assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success . The real estate and mortgage banking concern had %% hoped %% to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt . Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank-credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 . It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt .
hope.v | 0 | Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie %% hopes %% to have a new home for them . He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park . Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
hope.v | 0 | Not necessarily . Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may %% hope %% to receive the paid `` volunteers . '' So far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .

In fact , the network %% hopes %% to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it . But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one . In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
hope.v | 0 | The FCC effort collapsed . The networks and studios have bickered ever since . Network officials involved in the studio talks may %% hope %% the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely . In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue . A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D-Mass. ) , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony-Columbia deal . ''
hope.v | 0 | Spokesmen for the nation 's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form . They dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans '' . %% Hoping %% to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized . He is not likely to win this battle easily . In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to `` hustle '' it out of Washington .
hope.v | 0 | And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that . But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . They %% hope %% the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air . Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon . And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin-syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .
hope.v | 0 | That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now-scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM\/UA Communications Co . NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM\/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash . Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC %% hopes %% to find another . `` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says . NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program-maker without violating the rules .

They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage . `` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , '' says Robert Stengel , senior vice president , programming , of Continental Cablevision Inc. , which %% holds %% a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting .

Odds and Ends THE NUMBER of women and minorities who %% hold %% jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... .

Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . `` Investors , who had been %% holding %% assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said . `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
hold.v | 0 | ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold . It was previously thought ASKO %% held %% a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July . A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue . He termed ASKO 's legal actions as `` unproductive '' to international cooperation among European retailers .

hold.v | 0 | When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure . For the first time , the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . This role reversal %% holds %% true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens . But are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ? Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
hold.v | 0 | As usual , the real-estate market had overreacted . Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . Metropolitan Houston 's population has %% held %% steady over the past six years . And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
hold.v | 0 | So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts . The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never %% held %% a job in television or journalism . The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .

Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets . The games Bronx children played ( %% holding %% kids down and stripping them , for example ) seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure . `` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes . She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements .
hold.v | 0 | It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies . Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital . Employees %% held %% an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe . `` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service . In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it .
hold.v | 0 | Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha %% held %% that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .

hold.v | 0 | However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers . In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp.

Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .

Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be %% held %% in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 . They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .

hold.v | 0 | Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers . Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . The Reagan White House %% held %% the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .

If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ? Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a %% base %% salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?

The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a %% base %% of 100 . In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .

In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation %% base %% is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .

grant.v | 0 | The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by %% granting %% Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person .

bill.n | 0 | Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations %% bill %% would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .

'' One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction %% bill %% , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .

bill.n | 0 | Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .

'' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations %% bill %% , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .

John Paul Hammerschmidt , ( R. , Ark . ) said . The %% bill %% , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline . The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit . The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D. , Ore. ) that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits .

bill.n | 0 | It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these %% bills %% into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .

The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget . These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations %% bill %% in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe . To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon .

The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year .

The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 . The average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six-month %% bills %% , the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on July 31 , 1989 .

bill.n | 0 | The Senate 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction %% bill %% without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year . Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .

bill.n | 0 | The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs . The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor . The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a %% bill %% because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto . The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue . While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
bill.n | 0 | It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery . For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote . Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner %% bill %% are suspect . Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco . To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers .
bill.n | 0 | Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . The %% bill %% , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . `` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , the bill 's chief sponsor .
bill.n | 0 | The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . Supporters of the legislation view the %% bill %% as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired . It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
bill.n | 0 | Also , retail sales grew 0.5 % last month . A capital-gains tax cut was removed from the Senate 's deficit reduction bill , but proponents still hope to enact the cut this year . Bush wo n't press for a capital-gains provision in the final deficit %% bill %% when House-Senate conferees meet later this week . General Motors signaled that up to five North American assembly plants may close by the mid-1990s as it tries to cut excess capacity . U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6 % in early October , the first sales period of the 1990-model year , dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales .
bill.n | 0 | Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations %% bill %% for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .
bill.n | 0 | In separate floor action , the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 . The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights . The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce %% bills %% back to the House . The most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State , Justice and Commerce departments . And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference .

Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , the %% bill %% 's chief sponsor . The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC . This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
bill.n | 0 | The debate over National Service has begun again . After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington . At least 10 %% bills %% proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring . One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn ( D. , Ga . ) and Rep. Dave McCurdy ( D. , Okla. ) , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served . An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee .
bill.n | 0 | For the year to date , Moody 's said total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment-grade bonds . Junk bonds trailed the group again . `` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury %% bill %% has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report . `` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said . Moody 's said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October .
bill.n | 0 | Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations %% bill %% for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .

bill.n | 0 | Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation . `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting %% bill %% and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .
bill.n | 0 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 175 million in new cash Thursday by selling about $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills and redeeming $ 9.58 billion of maturing %% bills %% . The bills will be dated Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25 , 1990 . They will be available in minimum denominations of $ 10,000 .
bill.n | 0 | The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D. , Ore. ) that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits . Rep. James Traficant ( D. , Ohio ) , said the amendment , which passed 271-147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . '' But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the %% bill %% even more controversial . On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . The provision , called the `` two-time-losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .

The rally erased about half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , but analysts are cautious about the market 's outlook . The dollar also rebounded , while bond prices plummeted and Treasury %% bill %% rates soared . Junk bonds also recovered somewhat , though trading remained stalled . Gold also rose .
bill.n | 0 | The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . '' Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing %% bill %% , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald . As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
bill.n | 0 | President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations %% bills %% into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power . However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .
bill.n | 0 | The House appears reluctant to join the senators . A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions . `` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean %% bill %% can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate . '' Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks . He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .
bill.n | 0 | The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days . All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the %% bill %% in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service . But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge . One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies .

But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year .

House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . ''
bill.n | 0 | The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations %% bill %% passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
bill.n | 0 | While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor . Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt . `` The purpose of the %% bill %% is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , ( R. , Ark . ) said . The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline . The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .

It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify .

bill.n | 0 | Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their %% bill %% '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

bill.n | 0 | Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? Not necessarily . Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the %% bill %% now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers .

In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant . The sweeping nature of the %% bill %% draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market . Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 . About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .
bill.n | 0 | The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3\/32 for a yield of 7.97 % , compared with 101 9\/32 to yield 7.84 % . Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction . The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury %% bills %% was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 .

It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . The %% bill %% would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days . All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service .

The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting %% bill %% . `` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press .

effect.n | 0 | Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors . Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered . Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating %% effect %% on the economy . Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved . Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .

Maxtor said its results were boosted by $ 2 million in payments received from a supplier , for a certain line of products that Maxtor is n't going to sell anymore . Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive %% effect %% on future earnings and revenue .

Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment .

But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial %% effects %% of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies .

Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the %% effects %% on the young people providing those services alter the calculation . Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .
effect.n | 0 | The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 . But the full %% effect %% on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts say . On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged .

Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level . `` Auto prices had a big %% effect %% in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said . Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group . He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .

The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative %% effect %% of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results . NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .

In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter . The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` %% effect %% .

This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .

In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually %% completed %% , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy . Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; ; they are not anchored directly to the bone . Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .

As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should %% complete %% the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .

The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional %% conditions %% in legislation that violate the separation of powers .

In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . Even without portfolio insurance , market %% conditions %% were grim Friday , money managers said . Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . `` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .

President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional %% conditions %% on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .

condition.n | 0 | No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic %% conditions %% arose . The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .

'' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional %% conditions %% on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .

condition.n | 0 | Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional %% conditions %% in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
condition.n | 0 | To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint %% conditions %% for halting trading or staying open . Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
condition.n | 0 | Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional %% conditions %% contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .

The nation 's main white opposition party warned that the government 's release Sunday of eight black political prisoners risked bringing chaos and eventual black Marxist rule to the nation .
condition.n | 0 | Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . `` I think the resurgence { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit %% conditions %% are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .

condition.n | 0 | Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . Under these %% conditions %% , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead . Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills , Calif .

The exchange ratio was never established . Weatherford said market %% conditions %% led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .

condition.n | 0 | Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit %% conditions %% slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % . The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % . The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
chance.n | 0 | The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . The `` October massacres '' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns . Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a %% chance %% for bargain hunting . `` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat .

chance.n | 0 | The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing %% chances %% that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .

There 's a good %% chance %% that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said . He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising . Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today .

Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . Vacancy %% rates %% in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .

rate.n | 0 | Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . `` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work , '' the company said . Excluding the higher tax %% rate %% , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R.

In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge .
future.n | 0 | Short of a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't . One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks . Currently , margins on stock %% futures %% purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins . Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active .
future.n | 0 | The LME stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't . However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said . At one point in %% futures %% trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain . `` It was simply overbought , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices .

In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the %% futures %% of three U.S. car factories . GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade . The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .

The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents . Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains .

Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock , traders say . Heavy selling of Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index %% futures %% in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward . Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL , AMR , BankAmerica , Walt Disney , Capital Cities\/ABC , Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped trading and never resumed . The finger-pointing has already begun .

The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks . In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for %% futures %% contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal . Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold . The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .

The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , `` Our systemic performance was good . '' But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .
future.n | 0 | Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange . It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the %% futures %% markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively . Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .

Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions . In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and %% futures %% markets . Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated . At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .
future.n | 0 | No , it was n't Black Monday . But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos . Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and %% futures %% . The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .

future.n | 0 | Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders . Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight . Now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the S&P 500 %% futures %% contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials . Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago . After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down .

So far , Wall Street 's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a major %% futures %% marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading . Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in the past few days . A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co. , now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients .

In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a %% futures %% analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago . Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans .

Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective %% future %% dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered . So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .

Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ? That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .

future.n | 0 | A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate . In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today . Periods before the advent of %% futures %% or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change ( 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example ) . It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
future.n | 0 | `` Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . '' For all the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading .

That divergence is what stock index traders seek . When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks ( such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index ) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .

Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election commission . The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the %% future %% of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government . To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa . SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in

Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .
future.n | 0 | Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets . This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index %% futures %% had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . They did n't .

'' However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index %% futures %% buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday . `` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late-afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
future.n | 0 | After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down . As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . Without the guidepost of stock-index %% futures %% -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board . The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders . `` It screwed things up , '' said one major specialist .
future.n | 0 | The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor 's 500-stock index ( traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ) ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( traded on the chicago Board of Trade ) ; and the S&P 100 options ( traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 ) .

future.n | 0 | Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday . COPPER : %% Futures %% prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved . The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 . Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
future.n | 0 | Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace . The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it . On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago %% futures %% exchanges . These are the main proponents of program trading . Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .
future.n | 0 | Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . '' Short of a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't . One such proposal regarding stock-index %% futures %% is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks . Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .

future.n | 0 | A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and %% futures %% markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .
future.n | 0 | Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options . If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures . Stock-index %% futures %% -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date . The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount . The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor 's 500-stock index ( traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ) ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( traded on the chicago Board of Trade ) ; and the S&P 100 options ( traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 ) .

The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer . One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a %% future %% . '' He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies . The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season .
future.n | 0 | Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week . `` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said William Hinton , an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co . Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both %% futures %% and spot markets . On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel .

'' Arbitraging on differences between spot and %% futures %% prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says .

future.n | 0 | The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and %% futures %% markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
future.n | 0 | Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up . For example , stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched . Stock %% futures %% trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s . Now , on a good day , Chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock . Now the stage is set for the battle to play out .
future.n | 0 | The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and %% futures %% trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc .

On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon . Gasoline %% futures %% were mixed to unchanged . But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil . West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
future.n | 0 | It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90-pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season . However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . Friday 's consequent selling of %% futures %% contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . Brazilian juice , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities .
future.n | 0 | The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering . Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows .

future.n | 0 | Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the %% future %% . Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November . The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .
future.n | 0 | Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them . What 's more , the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it . Even some members of the Old Guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the %% future %% belongs with the New Guard . Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered . He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people .
future.n | 0 | It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins . Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn %% futures %% contracts -- only to see little appreciation . `` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director . Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .

future.n | 0 | The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P %% futures %% sell orders began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically . I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
future.n | 0 | Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins . %% Futures %% traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active . Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say . Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers .

future.n | 0 | A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast . Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility . On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P %% futures %% rise or fall 12 points . The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders . On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour .
future.n | 0 | The target of their wrath ? Their own employer , Kidder Peabody . Since October 's minicrash , Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and %% futures %% that can send stock prices reeling in minutes . But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market . The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards .
future.n | 0 | As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities . An appeal is expected . In response to the ruling , gilt %% futures %% swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session . Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 point lower . The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion ) , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .
future.n | 0 | Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years . So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade . Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn %% futures %% contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers . At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel . Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .
future.n | 0 | The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue . As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the %% futures %% market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?
future.n | 0 | But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds . The %% futures %% exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index . Options markets stopped trading in many securities . The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
future.n | 0 | This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes . Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards . A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial %% future %% . When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward . But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .
future.n | 0 | Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains . But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday . Until yesterday , %% futures %% prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand . So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well .
future.n | 0 | As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board . The %% futures %% halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders . `` It screwed things up , '' said one major specialist . This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .
future.n | 0 | London 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street . When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . %% Futures %% markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points . With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time . By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points .
future.n | 0 | Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers . The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price . But in 1986 , program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and %% futures %% markets . A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably . Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .
future.n | 0 | Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said . While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash . The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and %% futures %% prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day . Despite traders ' complaints , Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday 's rout to provide a cooling-off period . Of greater help , the Big Board chairman said , was the `` natural circuit breaker '' of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market .
future.n | 0 | In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago . Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate %% futures %% positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .
future.n | 0 | But there were no buyers . While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said . Stock-index %% futures %% contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
future.n | 0 | The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp . Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had . While program trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock %% futures %% in Chicago made some program trading impossible . Susan Del Signore , head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co. , says critics are ignoring `` the role the { takeover stock } speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . '' Many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' she says , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''
future.n | 0 | Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened . %% Futures %% trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange . It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .
future.n | 0 | Commodity %% futures %% prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday . Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness . Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
future.n | 0 | Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading . As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different . In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the %% futures %% market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York . To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago . If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .
future.n | 0 | While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said .

But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today . The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .

future.n | 0 | For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . Thomson feels the %% future %% of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans . The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H . In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .
future.n | 0 | Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it . Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago . A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his %% futures %% . Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago . The start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .
future.n | 0 | But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems . In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Crude oil %% futures %% prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil . Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market . Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

The most common program-trading vehicles are %% futures %% contracts on Standard & poor 's 500-stock index ( traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ) ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( traded on the chicago Board of Trade ) ; and the S&P 100 options ( traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 ) .

Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the %% futures %% industry , to set such margins . Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active . Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .

Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could %% find %% . But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .

need.v | 0 | Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market %% needs %% a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we %% need %% a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All too frequently '' , points out James O'Gara , managing editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades '' .

need.v | 0 | Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities . If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high . A part-time farmer %% needs %% unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .

Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it 's important to remember that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother %% need %% worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster 's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect . Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .

need.v | 0 | If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service .

To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?

For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . It is particularly suitable for those who %% need %% to work or exercise out of doors for their health . Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .

Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects . The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it : if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right ; ; if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .

Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude %% produced %% in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .

Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her . Did she know , he %% asked %% , why the colors of the tubes were important to people 's health ? ? The human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light . For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue .
ask.v | 0 | The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders . Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ASKO 's Dutch lawyers noted . Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then %% ask %% the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold .

If pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer . If %% asked %% how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others . Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all . Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another 's personalities , moods , intentions .

As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium . A stadium craze is sweeping the country .

Fleet asked the same question about Bridget , and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father 's murder and came down when she called her . Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .

The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was %% asked %% to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die .

Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . `` We got calls from big block houses %% asking %% us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .

ask.v | 0 | Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have %% asked %% the nations . But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? ?
ask.v | 0 | Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes . Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests . Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has %% asked %% Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic . But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said . Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said .

I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators %% asked %% federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . '' Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .

Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable . It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to %% ask %% for permission to set up office . Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location . `` That is a miracle .

Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches . During the second week of operations , Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department , %% asking %% him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip '' . Since Fogg 's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions . Over the weeks , America 's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .
ask.v | 0 | Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' . Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it 's to be a good person '' . When %% asked %% how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' . This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad . They discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction .
ask.v | 0 | This , in fact , it turned out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler 's crimes ; ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be %% asked %% for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .

ask.v | 0 | Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson 's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company 's local officials %% asked %% that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement .

Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity . Soon after the method changed , visitors began %% asking %% how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this . To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth . Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` This soil used to be like that hard packed road over there '' .

Her statement certainly was true ; ; the press reported the same facts in using Harrington 's interview , but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer . When I interviewed Kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard , I %% asked %% if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders . He said he had not heard of anybody else . `` How about Bridget Sullivan '' ? ? I inquired .
ask.v | 0 | But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration %% asked %% us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) . Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .

One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor . %% Asked %% why , he replied primly : `` Because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' .

If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public . And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to %% ask %% himself a number of questions about each . Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?

Nonetheless , they found common interests . During last year 's campaign , Kennedy %% asked %% Walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him . Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City . Walton , who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin 's paratroopers during the invasion of France , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy .

The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : `` It was the last %% hour %% of trading on a Friday .

The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one %% hour %% ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .

It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an %% hour %% after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .

The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years . By a 6-4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .

In fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't %% care %% a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits . Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .

Chauncey Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .

James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to %% affect %% the American and United Air Lines bids . It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .

The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference %% affected %% industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .

But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . And he has kept mum on how his decision might %% affect %% a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash .
affect.v | 0 | Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it 's important to remember that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not %% affect %% a youngster 's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect . Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long . If a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .

He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .

Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance . Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ; ; this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the %% affected %% part . As the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed '' . Insect bites were cured in many ways .
affect.v | 0 | I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled %% affecting %% the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; ; the other , for the most part , true . The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .

'' Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans %% expressed %% the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .
express.v | 0 | The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials %% expressed %% satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels . During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered .
express.v | 0 | Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience . His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman . Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , %% expressed %% some desire to take the whole thing over again . Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .

The White House said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
express.v | 0 | The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law %% expressing %% a moral judgment can not be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today . Up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .

begin.v | 0 | Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly . Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington . The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout %% began %% immediately after the UAL trading halt . Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .

Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier %% began %% to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. .

Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen.

The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash . The process of post-crash reforms %% began %% with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments . In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .

In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement %% begins %% to slow , '' he said . Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .

When Denver 's regional economy %% begins %% to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ? Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .

defense.n | 0 | A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws . The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer , introduced in 1983 . Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the `` press %% defense %% '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year . The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa .

The question is whether his only means of %% defense %% is the veto . Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .

disclose.v | 0 | In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . '' In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . Also in July , Ohio newspapers %% disclosed %% $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn . That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator . Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright .

The White House said the shipboard meetings next month between Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev will take place in the waters off Malta . The location was %% disclosed %% as the U.S. began planning the issues to be discussed at the Dec. 2-3 tete-a-tete . Bush unveiled a package of trade initiatives to help establish `` economic alternatives to drug trafficking '' in the Andean nations of South America .

disclose.v | 0 | An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have %% disclosed %% that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far-reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .

Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , %% coming %% as dealers introduced their 1990 models . Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase . Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % .

After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was %% coming %% up . At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country . And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .

Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid . The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder %% came %% up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .

But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas . Now , however , commercial channels are %% coming %% to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
come.v | 0 | The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents . But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed . Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan %% comes %% cheap . New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .
come.v | 0 | Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not %% come %% atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly . Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington . The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .

come.v | 0 | So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated . First %% came %% his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece . Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner . Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate .
come.v | 0 | No doubt that 's partially true . Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true . He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it %% comes %% to obtaining information from prior HUD officials . But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?

Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which %% comes %% on after 11 p.m . It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio .
come.v | 0 | `` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday . The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have %% come %% under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .
come.v | 0 | But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to %% come %% about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview . `` That did not happen .

come.v | 0 | Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August . Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion . But at least part of the increase could have %% come %% from higher prices , analysts said . Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % . Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after dropping for three consecutive months .

The most militant opposition to American TV imports has %% come %% from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe . So far , the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail . A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why .
come.v | 0 | Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin . The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are %% coming %% at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said .

'' You need n't be a high-powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure . The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .

come.v | 0 | While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high . And they 're likely to stay that way for months to %% come %% , analysts say . For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .
come.v | 0 | Proposals for government-operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew . The disease metaphor %% comes %% to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service . Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox . It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .

It also recommends better retirement and day-care benefits , and basing pay on education , experience and nurses ' demanding work schedules . But it opposes an American Medical Association proposal for creating a `` registered care technologist , '' as `` potentially divisive '' ; it says the %% job %% would entail an unwanted new doctor 's `` bedside '' extension . Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a `` clinical ladder , '' basing advancement on performance and education .

Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program .

An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year . The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .

Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's %% job %% in 1986 . Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction . Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .

Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .

Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of %% jobs %% and perhaps supporting families . As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .
job.n | 0 | According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan . Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced . As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 %% jobs %% world-wide . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece . An Upjohn spokesman said he had `` heard nothing '' to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .

My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a %% job %% ; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies . The statistics quoted by the `` new '' Census Bureau report ( garnered from 1984 to 1986 ) are out of date , certainly as an average for the Northeast , and possibly for the rest of the country .

This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it .

But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading . None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the %% job %% . Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up . The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
job.n | 0 | Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues . To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying %% job %% as a salesman in order to become a social worker . Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona . The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .

To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same %% jobs %% . Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? Not necessarily .

One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from %% jobs %% with advertising agencies . The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season . `` The studies { on closing the unit } could n't be completed until now , '' he said .
job.n | 0 | It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify . There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given . But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time %% jobs %% . Why call that service ? 3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .

job.n | 0 | Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said . Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips . Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the %% jobs %% data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates . `` I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out , '' said Richard Eakle , president of Eakle Associates , Fair Haven , Campbell Soup jumped 3 3\/8 to 47 1\/8 as the resignation of R.

In August , the company took a $ 343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan . The plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 %% jobs %% .

That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his %% job %% . The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force .

believe.v | 0 | Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many of them sincerely %% believe %% that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .

The luminosity of the water is now %% believed %% to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet .

Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise . At one of her news conferences , Mrs. Hills said , `` I %% believe %% we can do much better than 20 % . '' But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade . I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .

The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent . Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed %% believed %% in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have to wear beards '' .

It is %% believed %% that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . ( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage . )
believe.v | 0 | Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . Moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . %% Believing %% that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them . Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable . But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .
believe.v | 0 | The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes . To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , the framers %% believed %% that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .

believe.v | 0 | Upon arriving at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams , Secretary of State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements . '' The route which he had traveled and which he %% believed %% might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien . It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .

believe.v | 0 | To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers . As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to %% believe %% safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes . Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon . James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .

Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they %% believe %% in people -- in helping people '' . Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it 's to be a good person '' . When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' .
believe.v | 0 | At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and %% believe %% that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .

To silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : `` From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . I have been loath to %% believe %% that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons . `` However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . `` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .

Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities %% believe %% that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course . But it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .

It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many %% believe %% that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development . Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are .

The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach . With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , %% believing %% that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe . But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .

Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one %% believe %% that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe .

believe.v | 0 | One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he %% believed %% that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; ; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent .

The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per-ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments %% believes %% it is a first . Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services .

He said he %% believes %% GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .

Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .
believe.v | 0 | In their first two years in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams . However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed %% believed %% , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . The motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .

Second , they %% believed %% it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas . The name : Henry Hudson . This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine : The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson 's fourth in four years .

Dingell of Michigan plans to unveil today a proposal that would break with Bush 's clean-air bill on the issue of emissions that lead to acid rain . The Democrat 's proposal is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the president 's plan to cut utility emissions .
believe.v | 0 | Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples %% believe %% the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .

Wholesome snacks , no candy Since Mr. Clark %% believes %% firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons . To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains . On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .

The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut . The people who %% believe %% and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie . If Bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden . Bridget was born in Ireland , one of fourteen children .

authority.n | 0 | It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . If more information is needed , the secretary would have %% authority %% to extend the review period 20 days . All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost-effective service . But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .

President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week . Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian %% authorities %% . Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies .

The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday . The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .

The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal . Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local %% authority %% engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils . `` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said . Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings .

Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .

The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .

authority.n | 0 | `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide . The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established %% authority %% to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .

But many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations . `` I have not seen one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an %% authority %% on the subject . Says the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan , `` Volatility is greater than program trading .

authority.n | 0 | The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto %% authority %% since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
authority.n | 0 | Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end . But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility . A leading %% authority %% on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end . The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely . `` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports .
authority.n | 0 | Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints . Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge . The networks still are `` uninhibited in their %% authority %% '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .
prove.v | 0 | Nonetheless , they found common interests . During last year 's campaign , Kennedy asked Walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him . Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and %% proved %% so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City . Walton , who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin 's paratroopers during the invasion of France , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy . He provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with Mrs. Kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` We just cased the joint to see what was there '' .

prove.v | 0 | Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters . Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built . Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can %% prove %% it . Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds . He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
prove.v | 0 | As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade . The coalition was to %% prove %% inadvisable . O'Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others ' . He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone 's body .
prove.v | 0 | They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger . Questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him . The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so Morse 's statement really %% proved %% nothing . We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock . Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .

For Mrs. Shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee -- and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau . And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee 's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend 's clothing , %% proved %% adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee . The charge : violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs . The sentence : 360 days ' confinement in the county jail .

The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' %% prove %% to be a good idea . In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 . There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington .
prove.v | 0 | But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? ? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism %% proved %% less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? ? Was n't this meaning of Eichmann 's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .
prove.v | 0 | Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the requisites . Wine waiters are something else again ; ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts . Most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until %% proven %% otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself . Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! ! ) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all . This is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .
prove.v | 0 | Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry , Vermont National Guard , laid out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone Hill . The `` Barre Aviation Field '' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood . Though the makeshift airports were ready , the York State Guard flyers %% proved %% unable to keep any kind of mail schedule . They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 , planes . It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .
prove.v | 0 | But he 's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor . But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud 's cure-all gadget can %% prove %% fatal . Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide . For instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all .
prove.v | 0 | Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final Solution %% proved %% that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .
prove.v | 0 | Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty . What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that %% prove %% most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the A[fj] . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .
prove.v | 0 | `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' -- said Ben Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to %% prove %% Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .
prove.v | 0 | Franklin D. Lee %% proved %% a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . `` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes . Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .

Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable . It %% proved %% a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office . Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location . `` That is a miracle . ''
prove.v | 0 | Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ? Military service , moreover , could be a national-service option . Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would %% prove %% contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals . The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .

They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant %% system %% , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped . Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .

system.n | 0 | Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's %% system %% is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .

system.n | 0 | Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's %% system %% , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .

Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , %% said %% there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . '' One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit . Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
say.v | 0 | The exchange ratio was never established . Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern %% said %% , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future . Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November .
say.v | 0 | Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar ( US$ 705.6 million ) expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking . Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , %% said %% revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .

Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic . But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman %% said %% . Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said . Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug .

He , like Justice Brennan , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars . Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe %% says %% there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents . The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says .
say.v | 0 | Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall %% say %% he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . `` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month . He , like Justice Brennan , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars .

And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . Despite rumors that the TVA 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate %% said %% they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled . One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . '' Municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point .

say.v | 0 | Honda 's plant in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said . `` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added . Separately , Chrysler %% said %% firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models . Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall . At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .

The National Association of Diaper Services , Philadelphia , %% says %% that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services . Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one . Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services , Springfield , Mass. , where business is up 25 % in
say.v | 0 | Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely . In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue . A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D-Mass. ) , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , %% says %% Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony-Columbia deal . '' But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own . And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan .
say.v | 0 | It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 . But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts %% say %% . On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago .
say.v | 0 | John Kenneth Galbraith . `` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. Galbraith , an economist . `` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he %% says %% . `` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ''
say.v | 0 | But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected . `` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts . Colleges , she %% says %% , are eyeing registration through 900 service .

say.v | 0 | In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said . Mr. Bebear %% said %% Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said .
say.v | 0 | Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo . The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman %% said %% the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley .
say.v | 0 | The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese-style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics . Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen ( about $ 55,000 ) but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry . The World Wide Fund for Nature %% said %% that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders . A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids . Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $ 5 billion of business annually .
say.v | 0 | Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills . `` T-bills probably are the right place to be , '' he %% says %% .
say.v | 0 | In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official %% saying %% the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning . Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .

He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he %% said %% . The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . `` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
say.v | 0 | In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled . Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring . `` They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio , '' %% says %% Andrew Deak , a computer-science student at the Technical University in Budapest . `` The Hungarian { radio } reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . '' Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
say.v | 0 | Lucille Gorman , an 84-year-old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts . Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge . `` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she %% says %% . `` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing . On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .
say.v | 0 | Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ASKO 's Dutch lawyers noted . Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . ASKO %% says %% the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold . It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July .
say.v | 0 | She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets . At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief . `` My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he %% said %% , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues . `` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . '' Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market .
say.v | 0 | Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher . Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . He %% said %% such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan . But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest . ''
say.v | 0 | A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts %% say %% . That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .
say.v | 0 | Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc . But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash . `` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he %% says %% . `` Margin debt was at a record high . There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .

say.v | 0 | The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley . Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually . Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which %% said %% it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . Valley Federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in Van Nuys . Imperial Corp. , based in San Diego , is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan .
say.v | 0 | `` That did not happen . They learned they could survive it without much problem . '' But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who %% said %% a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .
say.v | 0 | The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts . It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier . Still , it %% said %% it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year . For all of 1988 , Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs . The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings .
say.v | 0 | Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through . But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features . `` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' %% says %% Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department . He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings . In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .

Some in the industry are skeptical . `` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' %% says %% Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .

The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp.

say.v | 0 | The Bush administration is preparing to extend a ban on federal financing of research using fetal tissue , government sources said . A temporary prohibition was imposed in March 1988 . While anti-abortion groups are opposed to such research , scientists have %% said %% transplanting such tissue could be effective in treating diabetes . Delegates from 91 nations endorsed a ban on world ivory trade in an attempt to rescue the endangered elephant from extinction . Five African nations , however , said they would continue selling the valuable tusks .

say.v | 0 | Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation . `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) %% said %% yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .

say.v | 0 | `` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . And our credit standards have n't changed one iota . '' However , Mr. McNamara %% said %% the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers .

say.v | 0 | Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas . Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks . AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group %% said %% it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise . An AGF official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas .

say.v | 0 | A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she said . At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti . `` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official %% said %% Sunday . The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .

say.v | 0 | As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . '' The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? Do n't %% say %% the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy . It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . '' But these are not the differences that make headlines .
say.v | 0 | Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results . Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up . `` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' %% said %% Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich . Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 . The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .

Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt .
say.v | 0 | But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts %% say %% uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash . Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .
say.v | 0 | Odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues . But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report . He %% says %% the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade . Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax . Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections .
say.v | 0 | The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion ( $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval . A spokesman for B.A.T %% said %% of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed . The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . '' That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added .
say.v | 0 | -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .

Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates , says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the U.S. . Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan %% said %% the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates . Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . Besides the lack of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan .
say.v | 0 | Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market . But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks . Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , %% said %% it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .

say.v | 0 | The state-controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France %% said %% it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10 % from the current level of about 8 % . Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas .

say.v | 0 | But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . And some %% said %% it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade . Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . '' Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . ''
say.v | 0 | Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5 % of the shares in Jaguar PLC . Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions , the company %% said %% .

say.v | 0 | Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC . '' `` If true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . '' But the court %% said %% it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas . Charles Haworth , a lawyer for Sunbelt , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits , because Sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 . `` This institution is just brain dead , '' says Mr. Haworth , a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth , a Houston law firm .
say.v | 0 | But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .

John Kenneth Galbraith . `` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' %% says %% Mr. Galbraith , an economist . `` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . `` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
say.v | 0 | He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases . Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units . Economists %% say %% an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .
say.v | 0 | Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which %% said %% last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . All that now has changed . `` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach .
say.v | 0 | The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise . At one of her news conferences , Mrs. Hills %% said %% , `` I believe we can do much better than 20 % . '' But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade . I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .

Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif . `` Those that pulled out ( of stocks ) regretted it , '' he %% said %% , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades .
say.v | 0 | At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti . `` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday . The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman %% said %% , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great .
say.v | 0 | Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry . A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials . A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she %% said %% . At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti . `` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday .
say.v | 0 | Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms . But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China . They %% say %% China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong . `` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates .
say.v | 0 | Mr. Egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country . But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be . `` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' %% says %% Leo Fields , a Dallas investor . He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading . But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .
say.v | 0 | The Boeing strike is starting to affect airlines . America West said Friday it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from Boeing . Saatchi & Saatchi would launch a management buy-out if a hostile suitor emerged , an official %% said %% .

New U.S. steel-import quotas will give a bigger share to developing nations that have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .
say.v | 0 | If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company %% said %% . Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market . But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
say.v | 0 | Does this signal another Black Monday is coming ? Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like Oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ? Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers %% say %% about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do . Joseph Granville . `` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer .
say.v | 0 | Things had just gone too far . '' Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . It worked , others %% said %% , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced . In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls .
say.v | 0 | Separately , several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them . `` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel . John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , %% said %% : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London . '' Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they saw no effect .
say.v | 0 | `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said . The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . `` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear %% said %% . Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
say.v | 0 | Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . `` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' %% said %% Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers . Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors . `` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said .
say.v | 0 | One week later , Leonard H. Roberts , president and chief executive officer of Arby 's , was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner . Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . '' The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , %% said %% : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system . We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings .
say.v | 0 | Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates . Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department %% said %% . While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August .
say.v | 0 | This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely . `` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he %% says %% . `` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . '' Mario Gabelli .
say.v | 0 | In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said . Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists %% said %% . Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations . The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS .
say.v | 0 | `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . '' Other money managers also opened their wallets . `` I was buying at the close ( Friday ) and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' %% said %% Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn . `` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .
say.v | 0 | But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech . `` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said . Moreover , in recent months he has %% said %% that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights .
say.v | 0 | It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said . New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear . Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst %% said %% . Energy Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week .
say.v | 0 | `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta %% said %% that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market . But some players were quick to seize the moment .
say.v | 0 | Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find . But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' %% says %% John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash .

El Salvador 's government opened a new round of talks with the country 's leftist rebels in an effort to end a decade-long civil war . A spokesman %% said %% the guerrillas would present a cease-fire proposal during the negotiations in Costa Rica that includes constitutional and economic changes . The State Department said there was a `` possibility '' that some Nicaraguan rebels were selling their U.S.-supplied arms to Salvadoran guerrillas , but insisted it was n't an organized effort . Separately , Secretary of State Baker complained about a U.N. aide who last week told the Contras to disband as part of a regional peace accord .
say.v | 0 | Hammond Co. , Newport Beach , Calif. , %% said %% Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement , under which it wo n't purchase any more of the mortgage banker 's common stock , through Oct. 31 .

Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level . `` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said . Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , %% said %% Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group . He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month . He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
say.v | 0 | Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants %% said %% the circuit breakers worked as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
say.v | 0 | Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain 's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1 % from the previous month , pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the National Institute of Statistics %% said %% Friday .

say.v | 0 | Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers %% say %% the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .

There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . `` This further confuses retailers , '' she %% says %% . `` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? Is this the wrong time to open a store ?
say.v | 0 | `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS . A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . In any event , Mr. Englund and many others %% say %% that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said . Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .

In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . Retail real estate brokers %% say %% tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . `` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc . There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 .

say.v | 0 | Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta %% said %% yesterday in an interview . `` That did not happen . They learned they could survive it without much problem . ''
say.v | 0 | Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply . The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen . It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst %% said %% . New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear . Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said .

Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .
say.v | 0 | It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP %% said %% that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur . People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .

Mr. Spielvogel %% said %% he would n't launch a hostile bid . The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .

say.v | 0 | He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington . Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others . If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court watchers %% say %% . `` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , '' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created .

In these locations , Mr. Friedman %% says %% , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined .

say.v | 0 | That 's the problem , is n't it ? '' Indeed it is . Congress has %% said %% repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise . But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive . The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .
say.v | 0 | `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' %% said %% Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .

We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' The group %% said %% it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings . In Florida , Renee Mottram , a senior vice president at DWG , responded : `` We do n't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives .
say.v | 0 | Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration %% said %% that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 .

say.v | 0 | Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. %% said %% it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .

National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .
say.v | 0 | Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 . Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms . But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists %% say %% Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China . They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong . `` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates .

say.v | 0 | Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue . `` The market was up 35 % since { President } Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli %% says %% , so a correction was to be expected . He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge . `` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity { this } week for guys like me , '' he says .

say.v | 0 | `` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers . But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump . `` I would %% say %% this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said . `` The core rate is not really out of line .

Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another . `` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman %% says %% .

say.v | 0 | Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities . Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' %% said %% a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods .

The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced .
say.v | 0 | The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders . But { otherwise } it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management . The executive %% said %% any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi . Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies . The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
say.v | 0 | His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color . Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors . ( `` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire-engine red , '' %% says %% Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . ) By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed . Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .
say.v | 0 | Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways . In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine %% said %% Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 . In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .
say.v | 0 | The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . All that now has changed . `` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' %% said %% the firm 's Kurt Feshbach . `` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day .
say.v | 0 | It was the Libyan leader 's first trip to Egypt in 16 years . They announced a reduction in formalities for travel , but did n't show any real signs of resuming full diplomatic ties . The Egyptian president %% said %% he would visit Libya today to resume the talks . Seoul and Pyongyang reached a tentative agreement to allow visits between families on the divided Korean peninsula . Such family reunions would be the second since 1945 .
say.v | 0 | But some players were quick to seize the moment . Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . `` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he %% said %% . `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
say.v | 0 | But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc . However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization . `` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to ( illegally ) acquire Western technology has diminished , '' %% said %% a State Department spokesman .
say.v | 0 | Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels . Northview officials could n't be located . Financial Corp. %% said %% it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds . Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company . However , the agreement was canceled in June 1984 .
say.v | 0 | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. %% said %% a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit . The company did n't elaborate . The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .
say.v | 0 | Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He %% said %% he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s . At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model . The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .
say.v | 0 | The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said . The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute %% said %% . That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .
say.v | 0 | While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high . And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say . For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts %% say %% . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .
say.v | 0 | Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' %% said %% Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . `` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .
say.v | 0 | Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from Japan . Now Sony , whose innovative , premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced in China . `` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' %% says %% Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube . ( Sony itself declines to comment . ) If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas .
say.v | 0 | Information International Inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper-publishing system , alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system . A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties . Information International %% said %% it believes that the complaints , filed in federal court in Georgia , are without merit . Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta , Ga . The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co .
say.v | 0 | Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . `` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' %% said %% Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago . `` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .
say.v | 0 | Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents . The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he %% says %% . Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role . Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , Roe vs. Wade .
say.v | 0 | More than 30 years ago , Prof. Harold Hill , the con man in Meredith Willson 's `` The Music Man , '' warned the citizens of River City , Iowa , against the game . Now kindred spirits on Addison 's town council have barred the town 's fanciest hotel , the Grand Kempinski , from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge . Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council %% said %% they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street . And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that `` alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights . '' The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years .
say.v | 0 | Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do . Joseph Granville . `` I 'm the only one who %% said %% there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer . `` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . `` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
say.v | 0 | A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . In 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect . Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis %% says %% , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading . Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad . `` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says .
say.v | 0 | `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he %% said %% . Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
say.v | 0 | The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . '' The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement . The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company %% said %% . Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law . '' Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock .
say.v | 0 | But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year . '' White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . `` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he %% said %% . House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . '' The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .
say.v | 0 | The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he %% says %% . Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed . But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .
say.v | 0 | That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year . In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month %% said %% the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 .
say.v | 0 | The year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million . The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine-related operations . Also , the company %% said %% its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts . Kysor , a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
say.v | 0 | Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . Sen. Riegle %% said %% he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent . Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . ''
say.v | 0 | Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including American films . `` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the president of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya . The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper %% said %% . Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union . Nedelya 's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado .
say.v | 0 | Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. %% said %% it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar ( US$ 705.6 million ) expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking . Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .

say.v | 0 | Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him . Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency . Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- %% said %% Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
say.v | 0 | Columbia Savings officials were n't available for comment on the downgrade . FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION ( Ottawa , Kan. ) -- Moody 's Investors Service Inc. %% said %% it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $ 20 million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes . The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries . `` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , '' said Franklin President Duane H. Hall .
say.v | 0 | It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. . The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' %% says %% one industry watcher . Retailers in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November . A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month .

So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained . `` Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she %% says %% . `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned .

But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump . `` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he %% said %% . `` The core rate is not really out of line . '' All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods .
say.v | 0 | Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . `` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' %% says %% David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd . Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre . Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China .

The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions . General Motors Corp. %% said %% it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares .

Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers . He %% said %% Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . '' He added : `` We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility .
say.v | 0 | The dollar was trading sharply lower in Tokyo . Prospects for a new UAL buy-out proposal appear bleak . Many banks refused to back the $ 6.79 billion transaction , but bankers %% said %% it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers . The decision was based solely on problems with the UAL management-pilot plan , they said . The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines , but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9 % jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation .
say.v | 0 | But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case . If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates . Then retailers `` will probably push the { less-established } brands out altogether , '' he %% says %% . Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. . To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market .
say.v | 0 | Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion ( $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but %% said %% it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval . A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .

Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars . GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials %% said %% .

The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .
say.v | 0 | The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts %% say %% , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .

An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . There is a great deal to be %% said %% , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery . For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote .
say.v | 0 | It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters ) . In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . '' `` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' %% says %% the writer . `` There were some very brave broadcasts . '' The listeners , too , had to be brave .

Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .

say.v | 0 | `` I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains . And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading . Glenn Britta , a 25-year-old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , %% says %% he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . '' He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market . You ca n't hold back technology . ''
say.v | 0 | Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades . `` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . This calamity is `` far from over , '' he %% says %% . Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find .
say.v | 0 | Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices . On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points . Professor Kolb %% says %% the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek . In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .
say.v | 0 | A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as `` deplorable '' but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents . The Contra military command , in a statement from Honduras , said Sandinista troops had launched a major offensive against the rebel forces . East German leader Krenz called the protests in his country a `` good sign , '' %% saying %% that many of those marching for democratic freedoms were showing support for `` the renovation for socialism .

Thousands of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia after the East Berlin government lifted travel restrictions .
say.v | 0 | He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market . You ca n't hold back technology . '' And the practice should n't be stopped , he %% says %% , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading .

say.v | 0 | It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site . `` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' %% says %% Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd . Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border . In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion ( US$ 1.29 billion ) .
say.v | 0 | Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says . Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits . Besides , Eggers %% says %% , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt . A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says . A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York .
say.v | 0 | Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million . Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . Officials at Drexel %% said %% they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment . In addition to $ 33 million compensatory damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages . Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels .

The space agency %% said %% it did n't expect weather or protesters to block the liftoff . The Bush administration is preparing to extend a ban on federal financing of research using fetal tissue , government sources said . A temporary prohibition was imposed in March 1988 .
say.v | 0 | In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . '' In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . '' The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , %% says %% King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services . Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday . In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year .

The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
say.v | 0 | Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U.S. News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine . Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington . `` Frankly , I missed my family , '' %% said %% Mr. Rosenblatt . In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly . But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co.

say.v | 0 | The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich %% said %% . GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich . That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .

'' Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash .
say.v | 0 | That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures . The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , %% said %% the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .
say.v | 0 | The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said . The state agency %% said %% the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said . That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .
say.v | 0 | But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said . Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman %% said %% . Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers . He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . ''

Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' %% says %% Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati . Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills .

say.v | 0 | CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS . That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' %% says %% Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job . The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force . CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks .

'' Mr. Heinemann %% said %% the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away . `` The question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' said Mr. Heinemann . Time 's rivals news-weeklies , Washington Post Co.

Curzio actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . Mr. Curzio %% says %% what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board . If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . '' If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . ''

In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers %% said %% . Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . `` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers .

He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , %% said %% that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .

It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said . New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear .

Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles .

say.v | 0 | As with other plastic in Britain 's high-interest-rate environment , the Labor card , administered by Co-operative Bank , carries a stiff ( in this case , 29.8 % ) annual rate on the unpaid balance . China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . The official China Daily %% said %% retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget .

The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , %% said %% it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .
say.v | 0 | Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating .

say.v | 0 | Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . `` I think the resurgence { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , %% saying %% that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
say.v | 0 | `` The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . `` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' %% said %% one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . `` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .

say.v | 0 | Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre . Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China . By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers %% say %% . It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site .

In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' %% said %% one government official , insisting on anonymity . The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning . Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .

In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision . House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .

He has %% said %% that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . `` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month .

In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .

Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years . And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August .
say.v | 0 | The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further pressuring profitability . Refiners %% say %% margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year .
say.v | 0 | To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , %% said %% , `` We 're looking like idiots . Things had just gone too far . '' Sen.

say.v | 0 | Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits . Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt . A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers %% says %% . A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York . A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
say.v | 0 | Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . `` I think the resurgence { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' %% said %% John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests .
say.v | 0 | Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 . The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month . Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week %% said %% they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline . GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago . All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines .
say.v | 0 | Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . The exchange %% said %% it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .

Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers %% say %% large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .

It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt . Lomas %% said %% Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor . It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company .
say.v | 0 | The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation . Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy . `` The market today has a life of its own , '' John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , %% said %% Saturday . `` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . '' Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week .
say.v | 0 | Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H . ) . %% said %% yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''
say.v | 0 | Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways . In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc.

In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , %% said %% it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .
say.v | 0 | In San Francisco , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls . George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark . He %% says %% he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces . Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters . Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .

And Justin , in a news release , %% says %% , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong-arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . '' Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters . He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive .

The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since . The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
say.v | 0 | Prospects for a new UAL buy-out proposal appear bleak . Many banks refused to back the $ 6.79 billion transaction , but bankers said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers . The decision was based solely on problems with the UAL management-pilot plan , they %% said %% . The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines , but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9 % jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation . Also , retail sales grew 0.5 % last month .
say.v | 0 | FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections . Odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues . But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' %% says %% Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report . He says the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade . Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax .

But securities analysts %% say %% Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings . So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp . Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies .
say.v | 0 | Ideal Basic Industries Inc. %% said %% its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal 's minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company . HOFI , the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60 % stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67 % stake in Ideal . But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company .

That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator . Mr. Wertheimer %% said %% the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright .

say.v | 0 | These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue . `` The market was up 35 % since { President } Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says , so a correction was to be expected . He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and %% says %% he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge . `` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity { this } week for guys like me , '' he says . Jim Rogers .

say.v | 0 | Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows . `` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming . Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , %% says %% Mr. Amos .

say.v | 0 | Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent . Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . '' Sen. DeConcini %% said %% , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . '' Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act . `` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .
say.v | 0 | Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period . But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in . Mr. Amos %% says %% the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts . Some in the industry are skeptical . `` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .
say.v | 0 | A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he %% said %% . Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said . Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
say.v | 0 | Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . `` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said . `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell %% said %% during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
say.v | 0 | `` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' If the dollar stays weak , he %% says %% , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much . Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go . He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
say.v | 0 | The listeners , too , had to be brave . Through much of the post-World War II period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary . `` When we listen to the Europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' %% says %% a Budapest translator . `` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . '' Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late-night slot .
say.v | 0 | The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as %% saying %% the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . '' The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 . Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .
say.v | 0 | In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision . House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while . `` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side , '' %% said %% Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) . But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year .

They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .

say.v | 0 | I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators %% said %% Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . '' Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous . The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''

say.v | 0 | Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' %% said %% Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) . But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision .

At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti . `` We have nothing to %% say %% about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday . The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .

Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis . Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to %% avoid %% making the financial markets more jittery .

They may then adjust their positions and movements to %% avoid %% too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; ; at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .

All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever %% avoids %% acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .

The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .

The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .

move.n | 0 | Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests , a %% move %% the news organization termed an `` amicable separation . '' Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months . His appointment to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and policy responsibilities , followed a several-year tenure as Reuters 's editor in chief .
move.n | 0 | Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people , or 25 % of the staff . A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting %% move %% . She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters . By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion .
move.n | 0 | Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd . The %% move %% closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp . Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million ( US$ 8 million ) of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday . The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % .
move.n | 0 | The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors . The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy . Earlier staff-reduction %% moves %% have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said .
move.n | 0 | The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a %% move %% equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc . That early-morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash .
move.n | 0 | Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their %% moves %% quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .
move.n | 0 | Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably . Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit . If government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets ( limits on price %% moves %% , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. ) , the end loser will be the markets themselves . Instead , we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants . Mr. Allen 's Pittsburgh firm , Advanced Investment Management Inc. , executes program trades for institutions .
move.n | 0 | But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity . Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push . French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the %% move %% was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .
move.n | 0 | Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 . Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers . `` There seems to be a %% move %% around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it . `` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific . Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program .
move.n | 0 | Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder . The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian . Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar %% moves %% . But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away . With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . ''
move.n | 0 | Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets . Anticipating the Fed 's %% move %% , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before . Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets . The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. .
move.n | 0 | The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio . Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM %% move %% that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec . Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars . GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .

The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile %% move %% on the Merc . That early-morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash . The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
move.n | 0 | Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting %% move %% expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge . Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan . But the pharmaceutical company said it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . ''
move.n | 0 | Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room . Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload . The %% move %% stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds . It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. . The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets .
move.n | 0 | Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program . '' But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated . `` It 's a cosmetic %% move %% , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co . According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan . Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced .
move.n | 0 | Bear Stearns posted a 7.5 % gain , while PaineWebber had a decline due to a year-ago gain . Blue Arrow of Britain plans to return to the name Manpower and take a big write-off . The %% moves %% may help the firm solidify its dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market . J.P. Morgan posted a $ 1.82 billion loss for the third quarter , reflecting a big addition to loan-loss reserves . NCNB 's profit more than doubled .
move.n | 0 | The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75 . Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent %% moves %% , saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll . '' He added , `` This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . '' But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared .
move.n | 0 | In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building . That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute . In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the %% move %% befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world . But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on . The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .
move.n | 0 | General Motors Corp. , in a series of %% moves %% that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity . In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories . GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .
move.n | 0 | Viren Mehta , a partner with Mehta & Isaly , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected . `` This has become a very politicized deal , concerning Canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , '' Mr. Mehta said . Mr. Mehta said the %% move %% that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto . The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada . The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught .
move.n | 0 | `` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time . An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year . The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the %% move %% wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices . The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer . One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . ''
move.n | 0 | Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin . The problem , however , is that GM 's %% moves %% are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said .
move.n | 0 | CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes . CBS insisted the %% move %% was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 . `` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August . `` This will raise the energy level of the show . ''
move.n | 0 | Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots . Things had just gone too far . '' Sen. Dole said that the %% move %% required sacrifice by every senator . It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced .
move.n | 0 | U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January . `` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. Fromstein said . The %% moves %% also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil . `` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York . The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added .
rush.v | 0 | The market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday . Trading ground to a halt as investors %% rushed %% to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers . Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades . `` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
rush.v | 0 | Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets . Most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs . Vesole %% rushed %% from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire . He was wounded , but fought on . Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .
rush.v | 0 | An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well . Then off again , %% rushing %% to keep up . We were miserable .

I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to %% rush %% . `` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
rush.v | 0 | He was wounded , but fought on . Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors . Bishop %% rushed %% on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One , Three and Five . Now the Bascom was mortally wounded . Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .
rush.v | 0 | This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says . Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors %% rushed %% to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find . But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .
order.n | 0 | For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies . Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying %% orders %% over the next few months . By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels . That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .
order.n | 0 | Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions . ( Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices . Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell %% orders %% . ) But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished . Mr. Freund , former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange , is a professor of economics at Pace University 's business school in New York .
order.n | 0 | The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell %% orders %% began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically . I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
order.n | 0 | ECONOMIC GROWTH APPEARS to be leveling off , latest reports suggest . Factory %% orders %% and construction outlays were largely flat in September , while purchasing agents said manufacturing shrank further in October . Still , many economists are n't predicting a recession anytime soon . The Fed is coming under pressure to cut short-term interest rates due to the apparent slowing of the economy .
order.n | 0 | One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore . And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace . The Soviet %% orders %% were compressed into the month of October because of delays . The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall . But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
order.n | 0 | But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market . Nobuto Yasuda , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan . `` Now we are looking for the time to place buy %% orders %% , '' he said . `` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . '' Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .

'' Jeremiah Mullins , the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , said proudly that his company executed every %% order %% it received by the close of trading . But , he added , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .

The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an %% order %% -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments . Though hoping to settle the case , Justin vows to fight on , if necessary . But the battle is more than Justin bargained for .
order.n | 0 | But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses . When trading was halted in Philip Morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while IBM closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 . Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' %% orders %% , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels . Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders . Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .
order.n | 0 | At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . Buyers stepped in to the futures pit . But the build-up of S&P futures sell %% orders %% weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again . At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points .
order.n | 0 | The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue . As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell %% order %% in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?
order.n | 0 | Newport Corp. said it expects to report fiscal-first-quarter earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents a share , somewhat below analysts ' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents . The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said %% orders %% fell below expectations in recent months . A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter 's figure , when Newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , on $ 14.1 million in sales .
order.n | 0 | Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing %% orders %% to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''
order.n | 0 | In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy . `` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . The government reported that %% orders %% for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower . Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all . A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .
order.n | 0 | NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets . The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter . Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large %% orders %% placed by a few of NCR 's major customers . In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc . These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .
order.n | 0 | When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points . With sell %% orders %% piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time . By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points . By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 .
order.n | 0 | `` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before , '' said Michel Vigier , a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont . `` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in Paris . '' Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell %% orders %% changed their line in mid-conversation , ordering buys instead . Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day . When Wall Street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargains .
order.n | 0 | That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs . By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year . China , which had been putting in huge %% orders %% for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product . Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up .
order.n | 0 | In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales . The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' . Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said USX may have received %% orders %% lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year . He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods . The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .

order.n | 0 | Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers . At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel . Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet %% orders %% because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought . With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver . Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .

The company , however , said %% orders %% in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter . Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .

That divergence is what stock index traders seek . When it occurs , the traders place %% orders %% via computers to buy the basket of stocks ( such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index ) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit . Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds . A program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000 .

Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting . But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8 .

The company said normal seasonal softness and lost %% orders %% caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter . At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .

It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .

At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell %% orders %% was overwhelming buyers . By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened .

During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered . That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve %% order %% imbalances in individual stocks . One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school . `` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .

Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to %% do %% that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen.

The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition %% regards %% as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God 's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .

go.v | 0 | Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it %% went %% to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .

Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board . Volume was 959.3 million %% shares %% , more than triple recent levels . PARIS : Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day .
share.n | 0 | Waterford Wedgwood PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ( $ 14.9 million ) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier . The results for the half were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts . In a sharply weaker London market yesterday , Waterford %% shares %% were down 15 pence at 50 pence ( 79 cents ) . The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts , compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period . There were n't any extraordinary items .
share.n | 0 | Wednesday 's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance , which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying . It ended the day up 80 yen ( 56 cents ) to 1,880 yen ( $ 13.15 ) . Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency , investor interest was directed toward oil and mining %% shares %% , which traders called a `` defensive '' action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation . Teikoku Oil , also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying , advanced 100 yen to 1,460 . Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500 .
share.n | 0 | The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger %% share %% of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries . Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community . Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .
share.n | 0 | McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a 21 % gain in third-quarter profit to $ 8.8 million , or 31 cents a %% share %% , from $ 7.2 million , or 25 cents a share . Sales rose more than 7 % to $ 94.9 million from $ 88.3 million . The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .
share.n | 0 | Apple Computer Inc. , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept . Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer . In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a %% share %% . This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations . The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period .
share.n | 0 | The brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock . Employees have the right to trade stock among themselves , and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions . They may also eventually sell the %% shares %% to third parties , but the outside investors who own the remaining 60 % of Coldwell Banker have the right to first refusal . Those outside investors in Coldwell Banker include Carlyle Group , a closely held Washington , D.C. , merchant banking firm whose co-chairman is Frank Carlucci , former secretary of defense ; Frederic V. Malek , senior adviser to Carlyle Group ; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh ; Westinghouse Credit Corp. , the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp. ; Bankers Trust Co. , a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. ; and a group of Japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of Tokyo-based Sumitomo Bank . Bankers Trust and Sumitomo financed the $ 300 million acquisition from Sears Roebuck .
share.n | 0 | Earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing microchip demand . Sales amounted to $ 771.4 million , down 1.7 % from $ 784.9 million . Intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ 99.3 million , or 53 cents a %% share %% , and that sales actually exceeded the $ 747.3 million for the second period . But Intel later succumbed to the stock market 's plunge , closing at $ 31.75 , down $ 2.125 . In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new 80486 chip in the current quarter .
share.n | 0 | The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again . Examples include Kollmorgen , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a %% share %% by Vernitron collapsed last month . Kollmorgen shares fell nearly 20 % on Friday to close at 12 7\/8 . Ramada , which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 .
share.n | 0 | As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of %% shares %% . So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ? All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 ) reduced volatility , 2 ) a long-term investment focus , and 3 ) a level playing field for the small investor .
share.n | 0 | At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points . The Financial Times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7 . Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million %% shares %% from 457.7 million Friday . Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .

Mr. Rocha Garza has said he wants to purchase more shares . In San Diego , Smith Laboratories President Timothy Wollaeger said the transfer of the shares is n't significant .
share.n | 0 | Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market . The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % %% share %% by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise . At one of her news conferences , Mrs. Hills said , `` I believe we can do much better than 20 % . '' But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade .
share.n | 0 | Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction . Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding . Previously , it offered $ 13.65 a %% share %% in cash , or $ 29 million . The El Paso , Texas , maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12 % rate , but would n't be paid for the first two years . The stock would be redeemed in five years , subject to terms of the surviving company 's debt .
share.n | 0 | On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 . `` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said . He targeted 7,500 %% shares %% of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes . The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , ( $ 13.27 ) and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers . But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .

share.n | 0 | On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping %% shares %% , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices . On Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said . But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand .

The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 . USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million %% shares %% outstanding . The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .

'' Prices for the 416.3 million %% shares %% that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said . While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash .

share.n | 0 | Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced , imported steel .

share.n | 0 | Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop . That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some %% shares %% or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .

Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value .

The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point .

There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders . '' Mr. Perkins believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $ 275 a %% share %% . Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it . `` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it .

On Friday , LIN %% shares %% were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 . Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers . Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock-market drop .

share.n | 0 | J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries . The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .

share.n | 0 | As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets . But with so many %% shares %% now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said .

share.n | 0 | Jaguar , a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors , gained 10 pence ( 16 cents ) a share to close at 879 pence ( $ 13.90 ) . It shed about 7 pence , however , after dealers said the market was disappointed that Ford did n't move to tender a bid for control of the company . Dealers said the U.K. government 's decision Tuesday to waive its protective `` golden %% share %% '' in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants . But the waiver also was seen as a signal that Ford , a major U.K. auto industry employer , was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar . Dealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford .
share.n | 0 | Some of West Germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits . A 16.3 % drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy . Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks ( $ 642.2 million ) by issuing four million %% shares %% at 300 marks each . Yet yesterday 's market cropped Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly .

At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants . While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own %% shares %% , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party . Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position . Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk .

In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the ballpark . '' Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a %% share %% , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month . Bristol-Myers declined to comment .
share.n | 0 | Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a shade . Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares . Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a share and $ 3.30 a %% share %% , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion .

share.n | 0 | The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's %% share %% is now estimated to be 12 % . While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach .

policy.n | 0 | `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's %% policy %% to include it . When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . ''
policy.n | 0 | The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will %% policy %% makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year . Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .
policy.n | 0 | These are all market excesses ( putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity ) , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in . Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday . If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for %% policy %% makers ? After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators . Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?
policy.n | 0 | Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests , a move the news organization termed an `` amicable separation . '' Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months . His appointment to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and %% policy %% responsibilities , followed a several-year tenure as Reuters 's editor in chief . No successor was named , and Mr. Reupke 's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives , the company said . In a telephone interview , Mr. Reupke said his departure was for `` personal reasons , '' which he declined to specify .

policy.n | 0 | A few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points . Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes . But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic %% policy %% .

policy.n | 0 | The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % . The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % . The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed %% policy %% . Traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected . In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .
policy.n | 0 | People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter . Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court . Groups have accused him of advocating %% policies %% that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies . Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment { and } respect for the law . '' A senior Justice Department official , however , said the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .

Also in Beirut , a Moslem group vowed to kill Americans if the U.S. implements a %% policy %% to seize suspects abroad . Nixon concluded five days of private talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing , but apparently failed to ease strains in Sino-U.S. ties caused by China 's crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in June . Beijing 's rulers complained to the former president about U.S. `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs .
policy.n | 0 | The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs . The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs . `` Public %% policy %% favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said . The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market . This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
policy.n | 0 | The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government . The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain %% policy %% options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations .

Meanwhile , as the first of more than 1,300 East Germans trying to flee to the West through Poland renounced their citizenship , a West German newspaper reported that regional Communist officials demanded the dismissal of hard-line leader Honecker . Secretary of State Baker , in a foreign %% policy %% speech , called for the reunification of Germany , saying it was the `` legitimate right '' of the German people . Gorbachev blamed the Soviet Union 's press for contributing to the nation 's mounting problems . At a meeting Friday , the Kremlin leader complained about recent articles that raised the possiblity of civil unrest , and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by publishing stories about impending shortages .
policy.n | 0 | With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit %% policies %% and financial management . The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
policy.n | 0 | Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants . Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 . Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open-door %% policy %% and economic reforms . But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China . They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong .
policy.n | 0 | In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash . Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic %% policy %% , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .
policy.n | 0 | But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate %% policies %% . But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets . Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before .
policy.n | 0 | The Bush administration , trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc , is questioning whether Italy 's Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets . Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control %% policies %% , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 . They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products . But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization .
policy.n | 0 | Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . Far better for %% policy %% makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .

policy.n | 0 | The president , at a news conference Friday , also renewed a call for the ouster of Panama 's Noriega . The White House said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . The administration 's %% policy %% was stated in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions . Ten of the nation 's governors , meanwhile , called on the justices to reject efforts to limit abortions . The Justice Department announced that the FBI has been given the authority to seize U.S. fugitives overseas without the permission of foreign governments .
policy.n | 0 | But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China . Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political %% policies %% . `` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd . Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre .
policy.n | 0 | Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . `` This is n't a change in government %% policy %% ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada . Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .
policy.n | 0 | Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control %% policies %% , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods .

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his %% policy %% objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .

receive.v | 0 | Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably %% receiving %% extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .

Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . '' In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party %% received %% $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn . That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator .

receive.v | 0 | If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration . But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now . Moreover , the electorate would have %% received %% a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice . As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down . President Bush should set things straight .

The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock .

receive.v | 0 | Not necessarily . Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to %% receive %% the paid `` volunteers . '' So far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
allow.v | 0 | The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school . In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques . Where a growing season may , with luck , %% allow %% 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail . Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat . Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .
allow.v | 0 | If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't %% allowed %% to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations . Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
allow.v | 0 | Palfrey 's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans '' . He proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high '' . Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would %% allow %% the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom . The women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage . He had a short private talk with each adult slave .
allow.v | 0 | When he heard of his brothers ' anger , Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages . If not , he was willing to accede to William 's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim . William was adamant on one point : under no circumstances would he %% allow %% the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry 's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom . Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes , Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once , and then send them on to Liberia . Lacking specific instructions , he agreed to William 's condition .
allow.v | 0 | This invariably effaces any wine 's character , and drives its fragrance underground . It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums , double Magnums , Jeroboams , Methuselahs , and Imperiales , respectively . Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and %% allowed %% some air . But white wines never ! ! White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .
allow.v | 0 | Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that %% allows %% minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 .
allow.v | 0 | Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold . Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive . The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is %% allowed %% to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .
allow.v | 0 | All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce '' . Palfrey agreed ; ; the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account . William 's threat that under no conditions would he %% allow %% `` freedom-conscious '' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before . Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience '' . From Cambridge , Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .
allow.v | 0 | And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly %% allowing %% himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .
allow.v | 0 | Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter . `` Butter salve '' or `` butter ointment '' was used for burns , and for bruises as well . This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and %% allowing %% it to boil ; ; when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled . Cow 's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly . One man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .

While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development . Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and %% allowed %% little or no advertising . Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are . But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .
allow.v | 0 | Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences . As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were %% allowed %% to simmer . '' The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
allow.v | 0 | Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals . The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . A provision %% allowing %% grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling . The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care . With a tax-free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year .

To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or %% allow %% more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? Not necessarily .

He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States . Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling %% allowed %% these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise .

Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains . Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be %% allowed %% to rest for several weeks before it is served . This is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort . It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .

allow.v | 0 | The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature 's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , %% allowing %% the couple free choice . There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church 's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .

It is true that the best sitcoms do %% allow %% group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show .

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of Jaguar shares . The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum %% allowed %% under current United Kingdom government restrictions . General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares . GM said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest .
allow.v | 0 | After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to %% allow %% interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .

His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April . Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be %% allowed %% to see his family again . During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists . In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North .
allow.v | 0 | `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would %% allow %% some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods . But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc . However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization .

The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue %% working %% as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .

And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture . In other words , like automation machines designed to %% work %% in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white . At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo . To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .
work.v | 0 | With a tax-free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year . Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers %% working %% at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .
work.v | 0 | This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may %% work %% against the conscious intention of the woman . That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .

They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. . Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to %% work %% together and of the importance of the long-term view . Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher . Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade .

A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way . I know this %% worked %% .

Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank-credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 . It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to %% work %% on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt . Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor . It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company .

work.v | 0 | Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , former President of the Ford Motor Company , comes from a generation different from that of Eisenhower 's own first Secretary of Defense , Charles Wilson , who had been head of General Motors . Unlike Wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism . McNamara is the scholar-businessman . An inveterate reader of books , he chose while %% working %% in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann Arbor , almost forty miles away . He selected as Comptroller of Defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former Rhodes Scholar , Charles Hitch , who is author of a study on The Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age . One of the President 's special assistants , the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy , was co-author with Henry L. Stimson of the latter 's classic memoir , On Active Service .

Thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ; ; very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself . A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .
work.v | 0 | Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers %% worked %% as intended . Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .

Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .

In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .

Do not include all your spare time or all your family 's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .
work.v | 0 | Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs . For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . It is particularly suitable for those who need to %% work %% or exercise out of doors for their health . Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .

The importance of loving tenderness is obvious . The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play %% work %% on several levels . Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .

Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York . It is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who %% work %% there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps . The great world beyond beckons . But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish .
work.v | 0 | Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life . The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night . Frequently he must %% work %% long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up . It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .

Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that %% work %% quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . Prevention is best as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be . `` After your child 's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it 's time for that first dental appointment '' , Dr. Brodie advises .

work.v | 0 | Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash . Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts . In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't %% work %% , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands .

power.n | 0 | As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a %% power %% of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills . If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .

I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology %% explains %% glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .

Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to %% explain %% nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .

A `` mental image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension . Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory %% explaining %% their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .

But other %% people %% do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features . `` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department . He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings .

And I think a lot of %% people %% will harp on program trading . It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront .

people.n | 0 | Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement ( Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 ) , `` If you have a million %% people %% working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things . Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ? Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador .

Thus , Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . `` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other %% people %% will want to see , '' concedes Colin Young , head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School . While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development . Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .

Careers Count Most For the Well-to-Do MANY AFFLUENT %% people %% place personal success and money above family .

Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families .
people.n | 0 | The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . '' %% People %% familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter . Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court . Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .
people.n | 0 | It was outrageous . And it was stupid . The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own %% people %% . That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day . Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .
people.n | 0 | Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon . To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . To the detriment of many low-income %% people %% , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen.

people.n | 0 | Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted . `` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of %% people %% that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls . In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . '' In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .

people.n | 0 | Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs . But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation . Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving %% people %% without its becoming some billion-dollar morass . We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases . They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .

Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC . These 3.8 million %% people %% also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts . A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link . Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .

Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all .

people.n | 0 | The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . The gains , to be sure , are rather small . Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 %% people %% , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says . Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people .

Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints . Few %% people %% privy to the talks expect the studios to budge . The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .

'' If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ? It probably would , because few or none of the %% people %% upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .

We have made no such statement . It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
people.n | 0 | CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks . Says Mr. Mosettig : `` CNN is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything . But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in %% people %% .

people.n | 0 | Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are rallying . On Thursday , William Fleckenstein , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most %% people %% suppose . In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high .

However , most %% people %% , having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx , look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe 's Sherman McCoy did in `` Bonfire of the Vanities '' -- as a wrong turn into hell . But Laura Cunningham 's Bronx , her childhood Bronx of the '50s , is something else altogether . In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' ( Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 ) , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic ( real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five ) .

But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American %% people %% and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest .

Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks . AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but %% people %% close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .

However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .

people.n | 0 | For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona . The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other %% people %% as well as to himself . But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .

people.n | 0 | While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach . With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many %% people %% tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .

But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the %% source %% indicated . GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year . Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .

There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch %% set %% with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 '' .

Before the sun had %% set %% on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . `` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said . `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .

Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .

'' One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to %% raise %% the federal borrowing limit . Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month . The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress .

When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda . Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` %% raised %% the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers . Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .

It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees . Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have %% raised %% $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 . A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised . The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen.

raise.v | 0 | Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy . Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . If the transaction %% raised %% objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations .

raise.v | 0 | As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise %% raised %% by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands . The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .

And market expectations clearly have been %% raised %% by the capital gains victory in the House last month .

contribute.v | 0 | Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries %% contributed %% to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have asked the nations .

So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start . The average plunged some 600 %% points %% , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading . But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 . Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out .

Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 . Ten %% points %% of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % .

The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 %% points %% , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .

It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 %% points %% . Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .

The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .

The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage %% point %% to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 .

The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back . That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who %% joins %% Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state .

A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer . He recalled Lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys ' study hall to %% join %% the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond '' . The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .

Within a few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were %% joined %% by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders ' empire .

Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned %% joining %% a synagogue or temple .

The `` social dimension '' -- worker concerns -- of the European Community 's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort `` off the rails '' if not done reasonably , says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle .

Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative . Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new %% state %% laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs . Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said . In Kalamazoo , Mich. , Upjohn declined comment .
state.n | 0 | The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . `` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said . Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine %% states %% where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion ( $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .
state.n | 0 | The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department . Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday . Most of those %% states %% set farm income records . The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains . What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs .

California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion . Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm %% states %% to log a decline in net cash income . Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department . Many lost their farms .
state.n | 0 | But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ? The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit . The key here is the ambition of %% state %% Attorney General John Van de Kamp . He 's running for governor . Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .

The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period . `` Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal %% state %% into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. Edwards argued . Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large . Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .

The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad . `` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw %% state %% for cash .

That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute . In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world .
state.n | 0 | Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up . What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ? In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la Sen. Chris Dodd ) , a competitive grants program to %% states %% to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service work-study program for students ( pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others ) , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs . Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million .

Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity . Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered %% state %% agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched . Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court .

state.n | 0 | The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other %% states %% where the defense is permitted under state law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .

Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says . Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and %% state %% disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .

state.n | 0 | The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions . Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the %% state %% has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .

Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 %% states %% in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday . Most of those states set farm income records . The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains .
state.n | 0 | The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions . Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a %% state %% restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .

Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single %% state %% could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem . But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ? The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .

In what was considered the largest protest in the Communist %% state %% 's 40-year history , at least 120,000 demonstrators marched through the southern city of Leipzig to press demands for democratic freedoms , opposition activists said . Police did n't intervene . Meanwhile , as the first of more than 1,300 East Germans trying to flee to the West through Poland renounced their citizenship , a West German newspaper reported that regional Communist officials demanded the dismissal of hard-line leader Honecker .
state.n | 0 | The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said . The %% state %% agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said . That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .

From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower %% states %% , such as North Carolina . Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .

Seven %% states %% that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska . Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue . But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .

Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says .

That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial %% state %% .

The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s . Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi ( now serving a jail sentence ) , the company began a career of bribing federal , %% state %% and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E.

state.n | 0 | The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under %% state %% law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year . The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team .

As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the %% state %% of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .

The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult %% state %% budget .

What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ? If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new %% state %% environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty . The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment . Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .

To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit %% states %% , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas . Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress .

position.n | 0 | Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any %% position %% of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government . The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .

In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider %% positions %% . In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets . Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .

Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their %% positions %% at any cost Monday morning . `` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago-based options trader . Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .
position.n | 0 | Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought . With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver . Farmers are in the best %% position %% of many years to push up corn prices . Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .
position.n | 0 | To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago . If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times . ( Few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % %% position %% should stocks rise . ) By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 . That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective .
position.n | 0 | Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors . The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their %% position %% . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .

The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990 , when each will adopt the First of America name . Kalamazoo , Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management %% positions %% of the former Midwest Financial parent company . First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America . But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America 's operating results for 1989 by $ 3 million to $ 4 million , or 15 cents to 20 cents a share .
position.n | 0 | From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina . Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his %% position %% in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
position.n | 0 | The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself . `` The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost . The court noted the new USIA %% position %% but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . '' -- The USIA said that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute . `` The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. McCormick noted .
position.n | 0 | Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any %% position %% for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .

Omnicare said it expects the division to add `` substantial sales volume and to make a positive contribution to our earnings in 1990 and beyond .

I had sought , in my suit , the right to print Voice material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information . But the court disagreed .

CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS . That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it %% sees %% the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job .

That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge . Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to %% see %% in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward . `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS .

In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party . The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .

But Republican senators %% saw %% no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .

The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 .

development.n | 0 | A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment . For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package . The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and %% development %% assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration . The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget . These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .

It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components . The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international %% developments %% . `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital . He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .

The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant . In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in %% development %% assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant . The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market . Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .

In a related %% development %% , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .

But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal year 's net of $ 70 million , or $ 2.19 a share , primarily because of $ 200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations . Harry Millis , an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland , said GenCorp 's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly %% plant %% in Kansas , run by a private subcontractor , that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp 's Aerojet Ordnance business . Transamerica Corp. , San Francisco , said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier . The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1 % to $ 93.9 million , or $ 1.19 a share , compared with $ 92.9 million , or $ 1.18 a share , the year earlier .

keep.v | 0 | In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann %% kept %% trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .

Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is %% kept %% downward at all times .

In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen.

Chris Dodd ) , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service work-study program for students ( pleasing to the palate of Sen.

Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .

The necessity for %% keeping %% alert to his bride 's hazards can act as an interference with the man 's spontaneous desire .

And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team . `` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network .

He set out to %% keep %% Troop H the best troop in the best regiment . One of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop . Even the mess sergeant , Bill Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .
keep.v | 0 | These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must %% keep %% in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .

Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to %% keep %% the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores . He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward .

Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by %% keeping %% them home . The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically . One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .

The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure . The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to %% keep %% Mr. Mandela behind bars . Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .

The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to %% keep %% market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading . After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .

Seeking to %% keep %% Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law . Since then , life has changed a lot for 61-year-old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner . `` I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says .

Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to %% keep %% sales up . `` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich . Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 .
keep.v | 0 | The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines %% kept %% over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good . If this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; ; it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk . A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .

China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in %% keeping %% prices down . The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget .

Though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten . Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to %% keep %% longer ; ; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy . Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more . If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .

But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . Until then , limited stocks are likely to %% keep %% prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts say . On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago .

Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her . Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people 's health ? ?

The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over . The waves may %% keep %% coming for many hours . Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest . Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P.

CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't %% keep %% viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV . `` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering ( and no relation to Ted Turner ) . `` You ca n't live on that .

maintain.v | 0 | Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that . But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed . Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband %% maintains %% his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards .

Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other . Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would %% maintain %% its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles . Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor . The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .

How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to %% maintain %% that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .

Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience '' . From Cambridge , Palfrey %% maintained %% a close interest in the welfare of his slaves . In fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased . Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once .

In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques . Where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .

The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent . Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in %% maintaining %% their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have to wear beards '' .
maintain.v | 0 | There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion 's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been %% maintained %% with more or less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .
maintain.v | 0 | In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that %% maintaining %% artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers . In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers . Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .
