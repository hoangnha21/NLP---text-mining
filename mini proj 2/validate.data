capital.n | 1 | The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say . Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness . `` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of %% capital %% , '' a Drexel spokesman said . `` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view . Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
capital.n | 1 | This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut . The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the %% capital %% gains victory in the House last month . An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
capital.n | 1 | `` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC . The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes . Absent other working %% capital %% , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets . `` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said . The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
capital.n | 1 | Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 . Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years . The firm 's %% capital %% , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say . Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness . `` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said .
capital.n | 1 | Municipals Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1\/4 to 3\/4 point lower in late dealings . The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a %% capital %% markets rally . Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness . Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n't at hand .
capital.n | 1 | Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution . CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion . It said the sale would give it positive tangible %% capital %% of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards . CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million . Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .
capital.n | 1 | The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion . Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise %% capital %% . During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit . Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .
capital.n | 1 | No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market . But some players were quick to seize the moment . Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on %% capital %% gains . `` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said . `` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
capital.n | 1 | `` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . '' Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead . What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own %% capital %% via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings . That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors . Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
capital.n | 1 | RMS International Inc. , Hasbrouk Heights , N.J. , facing a cash-flow squeeze , said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders . The company said that because of softening sales it is n't in compliance with requirements that it maintain $ 3 million in working %% capital %% . RMS distributes electronic devices and produces power supplies and plastic literature displays . RMS said it had a loss of $ 158,666 , or 10 cents a share , in the third quarter , compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 26,956 , or two cents a share .
capital.n | 1 | This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit . Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates . But the RTC also requires `` working '' %% capital %% to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years . `` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .

exchange.n | 3 | Yesterday was , in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. , just your `` reasonably normal , 400 million-share , up 88-points day . '' When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone . They said the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other %% exchanges %% could n't have performed better . `` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. Phelan said after the market closed . `` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ''
exchange.n | 5 | It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components . The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the %% exchange %% rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital . He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
exchange.n | 3 | The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . After several more months of arguments among various stock %% exchanges %% and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
exchange.n | 3 | As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises . Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began . He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago %% exchanges %% . Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas . Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
exchange.n | 3 | The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation . The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , `` Our systemic performance was good . '' But the %% exchange %% will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations were n't met , '' he said .

exchange.n | 3 | Merrill Lynch added 1 3\/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 . Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares . At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other %% exchange %% officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel . Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months . Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said .
exchange.n | 3 | As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures %% exchanges %% reopened . Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
exchange.n | 3 | I think that 's less likely . '' Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world . The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign %% exchange %% markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading .
exchange.n | 1 | The test may come today . Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund %% exchanges %% made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday . But fund managers say they 're ready .
exchange.n | 1 | Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares . The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in %% exchange %% for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding . The exchange ratio was never established . Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .
exchange.n | 5 | Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital . During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit . Combined foreign %% exchange %% and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million . Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ 25.7 million a year ago . Interest income and most fee income was strong .
remove.v | 1 | One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' . Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight . This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was %% removed %% the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on . There were many cures for warts . One young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .
remove.v | 1 | Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting . Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied . With the European Community set to %% remove %% its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
remove.v | 1 | And return to the United States she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney 's office . Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women 's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her %% removed %% from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio 's , an excellent Italian restaurant . Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney . With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York .
feel.v | 1 | Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , %% felt %% uneasy . In New York City in 1958 , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city 's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .
feel.v | 3 | Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation %% feels %% must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .
feel.v | 1 | After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts '' . He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine . When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer %% felt %% intense pain . Leaving Lee 's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue . For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee 's treatment .

In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers ( after owners Anna and Morris Snezak ) , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii . For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she %% felt %% living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . '' Sharp-witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy . Little Lily , as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary .
feel.v | 3 | For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . Thomson %% feels %% the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans . The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H . In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .
feel.v | 3 | That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) . He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he %% feels %% is actually his . All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter 's own reading . That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .
feel.v | 3 | Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive . Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it . Twenty percent do n't even %% feel %% they are financially well off . Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others .
feel.v | 1 | MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family . At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates . Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly %% felt %% the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich .

While twothirds %% feel %% some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year .

New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear . Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing %% areas %% , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said .

area.n | 1 | Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho . In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which was a part-owner of the smelter , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program . The 21-square-mile %% area %% is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals . Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs . The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . ''
area.n | 1 | New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon . The thriving 34th Street %% area %% offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue . By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot .

'' In addition , Ms. Consolo says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price . A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue %% areas %% , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say .

area.n | 1 | When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ? Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan %% areas %% as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
area.n | 1 | The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun . The death of the Herald , a newsstand paper in a freeway town , was perhaps inevitable . Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular %% area %% with one of the regional dailies . The Herald was left in limbo . Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .

Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue %% ended %% at 98 25\/32 , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12-year average life assumption . Investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . But the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened .
end.v | 4 | The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to %% end %% up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle can not be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves .

end.v | 1 | Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said . While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have %% ended %% last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August . Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated .

One afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field .
turn.v | 1 | As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will %% turn %% to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands . The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .

Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational . With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has %% turned %% the tables on U.S. business . Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from Japan . Now Sony , whose innovative , premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced in China .
turn.v | 15 | Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast . Half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people '' . Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to %% turn %% on us at the first opportunity . Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev 's nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .
turn.v | 1 | Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters . On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain . On the second voyage , he had %% turned %% back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case . On the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic . Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .
turn.v | 11 | Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has %% turned %% over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore . Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes . Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests .
turn.v | 3 | Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to %% turn %% it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .
turn.v | 8 | Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc . . Perhaps you could n't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ? Outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might %% turn %% out some dandy little gadgets . Some women get a real thrill out of housework . They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .
remember.v | 1 | Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition . However , this does not mean that a child 's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family . Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it 's important to %% remember %% that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster 's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .
remember.v | 1 | If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene . He %% remembered %% exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had . One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .
president.n | 1 | December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 . January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 . Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice %% president %% of research at Elders Futures in New York . `` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said . Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .
president.n | 1 | R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's president and chief executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company . Herbert M. Baum , the 53-year-old %% president %% of the company 's Campbell U.S.A. unit , and Edwin L. Harper , 47 , the chief financial officer , will run Campbell as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named . The board already has been searching for strong outside candidates , including food-industry executives with considerable international experience . Wall Street reacted favorably to Mr. McGovern 's departure and its implications .
president.n | 3 | The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the %% president %% to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . '' Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .
president.n | 1 | The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season . `` The studies { on closing the unit } could n't be completed until now , '' he said . The group 's %% president %% , Peter Chrisanthopoulos , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment .
president.n | 3 | When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions . With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist ( who rhymed river with liver in a love song ) ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover %% President %% on a good-will mission . '' They came by their strangeness honestly . Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` Philosophy for Women . ''
president.n | 1 | But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of Reaching that goal , says Robert T. Foote , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital . In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as %% president %% and chief operating officer in 1985 . Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says .
president.n | 1 | James Robinson , 57 years old , was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives . He has been %% president %% and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp. , a division of North American Philips Corp. , itself a subsidiary of N.V . Philips of the Netherlands . Charles J. Lawson Jr. , 68 , who had been acting chief executive since June 14 , will continue as chairman . The former president and chief executive , Eric W. Markrud , resigned in June .
president.n | 1 | A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents . In fact , Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version . Thomas G. Dahlen , Big Bear 's executive vice %% president %% , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems . `` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says . `` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
president.n | 1 | Robert L. Bernstein , chairman and %% president %% of Random House Inc. , announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years . A successor was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , whose family company , Advance Publications Inc. , owns Random House . Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the Newhouse empire .
president.n | 3 | While researchers believe such transplants could help treat diseases like Alzheimer 's , anti-abortionists oppose the research . Rep. Dingell of Michigan plans to unveil today a proposal that would break with Bush 's clean-air bill on the issue of emissions that lead to acid rain . The Democrat 's proposal is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the %% president %% 's plan to cut utility emissions . House-Senate conferees approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland . The plan relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
president.n | 1 | `` When you see a runaway train , '' says Steve Janachowski , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. Front , executive vice %% president %% and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion . On the one hand , Mr. Front says , it would be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . '' On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy .
president.n | 1 | David A. DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named %% president %% and chief operating officer in August .
president.n | 1 | That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors . Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years . `` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice %% president %% at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston . `` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's . Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
president.n | 1 | reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered . `` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said Robert King , senior vice %% president %% of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta . `` It was { like } the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago . Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .
president.n | 1 | Kenneth J. Thygerson , who was named president of this thrift holding company in August , resigned , citing personal reasons . Mr. Thygerson said he had planned to travel between the job in Denver and his San Diego home , but has found the commute too difficult to continue . A new %% president %% was n't named .
president.n | 3 | However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution . The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto . Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the %% president %% 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
president.n | 3 | `` That did not happen . They learned they could survive it without much problem . '' But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the %% president %% and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .
president.n | 3 | People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later . Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 . Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the %% president %% 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions . That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth . It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters .
president.n | 1 | He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp. , a division of North American Philips Corp. , itself a subsidiary of N.V . Philips of the Netherlands . Charles J. Lawson Jr. , 68 , who had been acting chief executive since June 14 , will continue as chairman . The former %% president %% and chief executive , Eric W. Markrud , resigned in June .
president.n | 1 | Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates . `` I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out , '' said Richard Eakle , president of Eakle Associates , Fair Haven , Campbell Soup jumped 3 3\/8 to 47 1\/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as %% president %% and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target . Prudential-Bache Securities boosted the stock 's short-term investment rating in response to the departure ; analyst John McMillin said he believes the company will turn to new management `` that 's more financially oriented . '' Other rumored takeover and restructuring candidates to attract buyers included Woolworth , which went up 1 3\/4 to 59 1\/2 ; Avon Products , up 1 3\/4 to 29 1\/4 ; Paramount Communications , up 2 to 57 7\/8 , and Ferro , up 2 5\/8 to 28 3\/4 .
president.n | 1 | New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates , a Butler , Pa. , architectural firm . Its radio series features such spots as `` Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures '' and `` Building a Place to Park . '' A harder sell , says John Kosar , the firm 's %% president %% , would `` detract from the profession . '' Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers . But such spots can be too soft .
president.n | 1 | `` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said Paul Newton , president and chief executive officer . A spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales . Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson , vice %% president %% of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned . The company said Mr. Wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall . Relational Technology went public in May 1988 at $ 14 a share .
president.n | 1 | Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber , 39 years old , who had been president and chief operating officer for the past year , was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain . He succeeds his father , Philip T. Wilber , who founded the company and remains chairman . Robert E. Lyons III , 39 , who headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed %% president %% and chief operating officer , succeeding Gary Wilber .
president.n | 1 | Some critics , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory . Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much . At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's %% president %% of North America operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . '' The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . `` I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says Tom Humphries , director of marketing for GRiD .
president.n | 1 | Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns . The government 's action was unusual . Alan Nymark , executive vice %% president %% of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . `` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .
president.n | 1 | Robert G. Walden , 62 years old , was elected a director of this provider of advanced technology systems and services , increasing the board to eight members . He retired as senior vice %% president %% , finance and administration , and chief financial officer of the company Oct. 1 .
president.n | 1 | At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared headlined `` Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop . '' The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market . However , Jeffrey B. Lane , %% president %% of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , said that Friday 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it reinforces the concern of volatility . And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading . It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . ''
president.n | 1 | Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth , Calif. , facility . The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine , Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid , caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system , and stored hazardous materials in leaky , unlabeled or open-top containers . Named as defendants were Roland Matthews , president , and Peter Jonas , executive vice %% president %% and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager . The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August . `` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court . ''
president.n | 1 | He also is a consensus manager , insiders say . The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll . Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as %% president %% of Virginia Polytechnic Institute . Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn . But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
president.n | 1 | At the time , a group called R.B. Partners Ltd. , consisting of eight of Arby 's largest franchisees , offered more than $ 200 million to buy Arby 's Inc. , which is part of DWG Corp . DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner . One week later , Leonard H. Roberts , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Arby 's , was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner . Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . '' The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system .
president.n | 3 | The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the %% president %% to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations . Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny .
president.n | 1 | Pan Am has subpoenaed several government agencies , including the CIA and FBI , to determine whether they were warned that a bomb had been planted aboard a jet that exploded over Scotland last December , killing 270 people . The airline is attempting to show that Israel and West Germany warned the U.S. about the impending attack . Died : James A. Attwood , 62 , retired chairman and %% president %% of Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York , Tuesday , in New York City , of an acute anemic condition .
president.n | 1 | Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips . Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates . `` I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out , '' said Richard Eakle , %% president %% of Eakle Associates , Fair Haven , Campbell Soup jumped 3 3\/8 to 47 1\/8 as the resignation of R.

president.n | 1 | Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors . The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals . The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad . `` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash . Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .
hope.v | 1 | Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves . After promoting Frost 's appearance at the Inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members , members of Congress , and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium . The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , %% hoping %% thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration . His Ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response . One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan , sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan '' to Salem , Illinois , Bryan 's birthplace .
hope.v | 1 | Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . Mr. Bentsen said he %% hopes %% the Senate will consider that measure soon . To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .
hope.v | 1 | There he 'd take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he 'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him . Bob Fogg did n't have today 's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems . At the end of the calculated time he 'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and %% hope %% to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable . Usually back in Concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg 's hot broth before starting the second trip . Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .
hope.v | 1 | `` However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . `` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind . This country has not used them , and I %% hope %% that we never will be compelled to use them . I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' . The following month the invasion of Italy was begun , and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy .
hope.v | 1 | Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . The shorts sell borrowed shares , %% hoping %% to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . All that now has changed .
hope.v | 1 | `` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming . Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos . And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives %% hope %% will keep people tuned in . Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier . Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .
hold.v | 2 | Glenn Britta , a 25-year-old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . '' He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market . You ca n't %% hold %% back technology . '' And the practice should n't be stopped , he says , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . '' Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .
hold.v | 5 | Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it %% holds %% a 15 % stake in Ahold . It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July . A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue .
hold.v | 4 | Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he %% held %% a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination .
hold.v | 5 | A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties . Information International said it believes that the complaints , filed in federal court in Georgia , are without merit . Closely %% held %% Morris Communications is based in Augusta , Ga . The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co .
complain.v | 1 | Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational . With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business . Americans used to %% complain %% bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from Japan . Now Sony , whose innovative , premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced in China . `` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube .
complain.v | 1 | In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , %% complained %% that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . To settle this slight , O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy . At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .

He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen %% bases %% in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run . `` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured . The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .

The plan relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment . South Africa accused armed Namibian nationalist guerrillas of crossing from %% bases %% in neighboring Angola , violating U.N.-supervised peace plans for the territory 's independence from Pretoria .

'' Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch . `` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can %% grant %% in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says . `` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize .
bill.n | 3 | Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) . But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other %% bills %% would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision . House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .
bill.n | 3 | The Senate 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year . Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . Lawmakers drastically streamlined the %% bill %% to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) . But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .
bill.n | 3 | But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now . Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice . As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations %% bills %% lying down . President Bush should set things straight . If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''
bill.n | 3 | The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights . The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House . The most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 %% bill %% funding the State , Justice and Commerce departments . And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference .
bill.n | 3 | `` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman ( D. , Fla. ) , head of the House conferees . `` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final %% bill %% promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost . The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 175 million in new cash Thursday by selling about $ 9.75 billion of 52-week %% bills %% and redeeming $ 9.58 billion of maturing bills . The bills will be dated Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25 , 1990 . They will be available in minimum denominations of $ 10,000 .
bill.n | 3 | Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation . `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide . The %% bill %% is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
bill.n | 3 | Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million . It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators . The `` omnibus '' %% bill %% coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard . The aroma of patronage is in the air . Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
bill.n | 3 | But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire %% bills %% , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
bill.n | 3 | Georgia Gulf received a new takeover bid from investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries of $ 50 a share , or about $ 1.1 billion . The offer , which follows a $ 55-a-share bid that was rejected in September , steps up pressure on the chemicals concern . The minimum-wage %% bill %% worked out by Congress and Bush won easy approval in the House . The compromise plan , which boosts the minimum wage for the first time since 1981 , is expected to clear the Senate soon . Steinberg sought clearance to buy more than 15 % of United Air 's parent , saying he may seek control .
bill.n | 3 | `` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate . '' Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks . He has been resisting a stripped-down %% bill %% without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill . The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill .
bill.n | 3 | It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the %% bills %% containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .
bill.n | 5 | In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year . The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . The yield on three-month Treasury %% bills %% , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . `` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .

bill.n | 3 | The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines . In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal . Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the %% bill %% `` in its present form . '' Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . '' He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .

bill.n | 3 | Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . The %% bill %% intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . `` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , the bill 's chief sponsor . The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
bill.n | 3 | The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations %% bills %% . If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won . If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court ( assuming it can establish standing to sue ) , President Bush might win .
bill.n | 3 | It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan . While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels . Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration %% bill %% to address their acid-rain concerns .
bill.n | 3 | Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations %% bills %% for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .

However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive %% effect %% the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . Brazilian juice , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities .
effect.n | 1 | America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be . `` I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , '' Mr. Otradovec said . Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an %% effect %% on other airline operations . Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time . `` It 's so close to completion , Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , '' said a Southwest spokesman .
effect.n | 3 | `` There was no panic . The system worked the way we devised it to work . '' After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into %% effect %% . Traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour . One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders `` were just standing around watching . ''
effect.n | 3 | Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash . Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts . In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in %% effect %% in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands .
effect.n | 1 | Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York . Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area . However , after absorbing the potential %% effect %% of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said . That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said . Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said .

condition.n | 1 | To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today . They could still panic and bail out of the market . But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless %% conditions %% get far worse . `` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks . Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ''
condition.n | 1 | A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate . In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today . Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market %% conditions %% were undergoing change ( 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example ) . It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
condition.n | 1 | It uses a base of 100 in 1985 . In October , more people said that present business conditions were `` good '' than in September .

Donald Trump withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer for American Air , citing the `` recent change in market %% conditions %% . '' AMR slid $ 22.125 , to $ 76.50 . Also , a UAL group tried to get financing for a lower bid , possibly $ 250 a share .
condition.n | 2 | Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver . Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying . The industry sought to impose %% conditions %% that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates . But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion . Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .

Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Michael Derchin said he sees a 70 % %% chance %% that the parent of United Airlines , the target of a failed $ 300-a-share offer from a labor-management group , will be acquired or restructured within six months . Georgia Gulf added 1 3\/4 to 51 1\/4 after NL Industries , controlled by Dallas investor Harold Simmons , offered to acquire the stock it does n't already own for $ 50 a share .

Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .

When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now %% estimated %% to be 12 % . While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .

drug.n | 1 | The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used . Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against %% drug %% makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .

drug.n | 1 | Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used . But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope . Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the %% drugs %% differently and may have offered different warranties . The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages . But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .

drug.n | 1 | In Rahway , N.J. , a Merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections . Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac . The %% drug %% , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year . `` It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' Mr. Sweig said . In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share .
drug.n | 1 | But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said . Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said . Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the %% drug %% . The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin . Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing .

As a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' Mr. Riccardo said . Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big %% drug %% makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % . While that 's not spectacular , Neil Sweig , an analyst with Prudential Bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . '' Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication .
rate.n | 1 | Analysts , who were expecting Alcoa to post around $ 2.70 to $ 3 a share , were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results . `` It 's disappointing , '' said William Siedenburg , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange %% rate %% adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ 15.3 million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year . Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . `` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work , '' the company said .

rate.n | 1 | Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways . In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 . In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising %% rates %% in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher . Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .
rate.n | 1 | Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments . In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments . As interest %% rates %% rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them . The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities . The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .

Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 . About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world %% rate %% . The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray ( D. , Pa . ) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados .

Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest %% rates %% to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .

rate.n | 1 | But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets . Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before . Tiny movements in the %% rate %% , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets . The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. .

future.n | 3 | Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated . At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill . There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index %% futures %% and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . '' And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .

At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P %% futures %% resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . Buyers stepped in to the futures pit .

future.n | 3 | On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago . Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean %% futures %% trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .
future.n | 3 | Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . But nobody knows at what level the %% futures %% and stocks will open today . The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation . The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , `` Our systemic performance was good . ''
future.n | 3 | The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork . The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound . The prices of most grain %% futures %% contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering . Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows . A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip .
future.n | 3 | That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added . SUGAR : %% Futures %% prices declined . The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents . At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back .
future.n | 3 | `` It screwed things up , '' said one major specialist . This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings . ( In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in %% futures %% to lock in a price difference . ) `` When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms . `` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ''
future.n | 3 | Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said . Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman . COPPER : %% Futures %% prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike . The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 . In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said .
future.n | 3 | Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars . GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said . That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their %% futures %% . The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .
future.n | 3 | While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash . The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day . Despite traders ' complaints , Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago %% futures %% market worked as planned in Friday 's rout to provide a cooling-off period . Of greater help , the Big Board chairman said , was the `` natural circuit breaker '' of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market .
future.n | 3 | More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood . Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index %% futures %% to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets . This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
future.n | 3 | Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline . The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets . The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that %% futures %% and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .
future.n | 3 | Energy Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week . `` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in %% futures %% '' trading , said William Hinton , an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co . Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day .
future.n | 3 | The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders . On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour . If , when trading resumes , the S&P %% futures %% fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading halt takes effect . Also , the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day . DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing .
future.n | 3 | This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said . ENERGY : Worried that Friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum %% futures %% traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices . The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents . Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains .
future.n | 3 | After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century . `` Circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops : -- If S&P %% futures %% fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes . -- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes . -- If S&P futures fall 12 points ( equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA ) , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher .
future.n | 3 | The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October . COPPER : %% Futures %% prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains . The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 . Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
future.n | 3 | A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast . Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and %% futures %% markets in times of heightened volatility . On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points . The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
future.n | 3 | At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . Buyers stepped in to the futures pit . But the build-up of S&P %% futures %% sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again . At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points .
future.n | 3 | Dow Jones industrials 2657.38 , up 88.12 ; transportation 1304.23 , off 102.06 ; utilities 214.73 , up 2.77 . Bonds : Shearson Lehman Hutton Treasury index 3393.51 , off Commodities : Dow Jones %% futures %% index 129.72 , off 0.15 ; spot index 130.16 , up 0.91 . Dollar : 141.85 yen , off 0.25 ; 1.8685 marks , off 0.0055 .
future.n | 1 | Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents . The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant %% future %% , '' he says . Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role . Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , Roe vs. Wade .
describe.v | 1 | Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison . While he was in custody his wife divorced him . More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife %% described %% by a marriage counselor . This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .
describe.v | 1 | She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns . It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best . Clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler %% describe %% her to the arraigning judge : `` This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society . `` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County . In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him .
describe.v | 1 | To climax her Roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help . It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night . Discreet Italian police %% described %% it in a manner typically continental . `` There had been a threesome at the party in the suite 's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane 's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors . `` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .
enjoy.v | 2 | Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin 's foreign policy line . A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus %% enjoyed %% Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West . Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit . Latin America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon .
enjoy.v | 2 | A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same '' . The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances . Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely %% enjoyed %% the luxury of a writing desk or table . Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee . In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .
value.n | 2 | The tender offer by West Germany 's second-biggest commercial bank is in two stages . Dresdner is offering to acquire 32.99 % of BIP 's capital for 1,015 francs ( $ 156.82 ) a share . The terms of the offer put a %% value %% of 528 million francs ( $ 81.6 million ) on the 32.99 % shareholding . The Societe Generale banking group controls 18.2 % of the shareholding , while Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. owns 9.69 % and Financiere Tradition , a holding company , owns 5.1 % .
value.n | 2 | Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market %% value %% of those assets . But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . `` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said .
value.n | 2 | Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid . Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control . But some investors have used such filings to boost the %% value %% of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold . Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control . `` Maybe he just wants to make something happen , '' said one takeover expert .
value.n | 2 | `` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report . `` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said . Moody 's said the average net asset %% value %% of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October . Mortgage-Backed Issues Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
value.n | 2 | Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except Mexico , resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 255 million ) . Don Bowder , senior vice president and chief accountant , said the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$ 1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt . `` It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate %% value %% of the loans , '' he said . The bank said about C$ 525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending Oct. 31 . Mr. Bowder said the C$ 300 million charge to earnings would amount to about C$ 1.34 a share .

value.n | 2 | UAL would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance . Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate . Some takeover experts were skeptical , saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the %% value %% of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL . Mr. Steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf . The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc .
value.n | 2 | Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall . And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible . All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap %% values %% that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily . The program traders were in there , too , of course . But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was { also } a lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions .
value.n | 2 | Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds . In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in %% value %% . Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million . Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations .
value.n | 2 | Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk . But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered . These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost %% value %% . Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million . It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings .

Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to %% find %% he was bored . With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios . The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says .
find.v | 1 | China 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . The State Statistical Bureau %% found %% that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . '' The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 .
find.v | 1 | In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what . But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore . Another study %% found %% that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices . On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points . Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek .
find.v | 1 | Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to %% find %% enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .
need.v | 1 | Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she %% needs %% her ego lifted . In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple 's own affair , and ca n't always be measured by a general yardstick . `` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares .
need.v | 1 | A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . Pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble . The following amounts of water are %% needed %% per day for livestock and domestic uses . Topography and soil Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?
need.v | 1 | The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes . To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , the framers believed that the nation %% needed %% a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause ( technically a limitation on legislative power ) could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .
need.v | 1 | A celebrity guest , U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt , also won a bet that someone could pile up $ 150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin . Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes . If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows %% need %% all the protection they can get . European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens .
need.v | 2 | And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ? Communist gains In answering these questions , we %% need %% to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism 's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .
need.v | 2 | Debt burdens are heavier . But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if %% needed %% to soothe the markets . Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
need.v | 1 | When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` If you go home now , I 'll scream '' . More often than not he would bow to the inevitable .

She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday .
need.v | 1 | Richard Stewart is no special case . `` The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field . What do parents %% need %% to know about those `` years of the braces '' in order not to waste a child 's time and their money ? ? How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ? Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ?

Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast . Half of the population of the U.S. would be %% needed %% to work on arms just to feed the people '' . Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity . Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .
need.v | 1 | Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have %% needed %% it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land . But we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends . Parson Weems 's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States .
need.v | 1 | Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were %% needed %% to prevent a financial crisis . And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
produce.v | 1 | The company did n't elaborate . The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves . More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been %% produced %% at the facility during the past seven years . A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate . Freeport-McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market .

Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens . Attempts to %% produce %% `` pan-European '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show . Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France .

This time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America . His chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River -- but it %% produced %% no northwest passage . When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson 's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship .

The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings . A student orator `` %% produced %% tears from a great number of the learned '' even before the punch was served . Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the English language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .

More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years . A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that %% produces %% more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate . Freeport-McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market . Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners , as owner of the uranium-recovery technology , receives royalty payments .

After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that %% produced %% high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States .
carrier.n | 6 | `` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost . The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major %% carriers %% to Denver , United and Continental . Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver . Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
carrier.n | 6 | Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit . Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air %% carrier %% could be acquired . It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .

The Chicago company 's beverage %% carrier %% , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings . The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once . Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
carrier.n | 6 | Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air %% carriers %% Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker . Peter Otradovec , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines . Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .

Her statement certainly was true ; ; the press reported the same facts in using Harrington 's interview , but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer . When I interviewed Kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard , I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .

Sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are used . Here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , %% asking %% him to `` come in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him . In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .

ask.v | 1 | At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . %% Asked %% if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . '' Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .
ask.v | 1 | The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter . If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he can not possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less %% ask %% leading questions .

In New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : `` I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man '' . Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey 's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but %% asked %% him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana . She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately . At Lexington , Kentucky , Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .

The real estate and thrift concern , operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings , said it told the SEC it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension `` without unreasonable burden or expense . '' The company %% asked %% for a 15-day extension Sept. 30 , when the financial reports were due . Southmark said it plans to amend its 10K to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed .
ask.v | 1 | That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state . %% Asked %% about the speculation that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in . He was brought in to turn around the company . '' Separately , several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them .
ask.v | 1 | If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- %% asking %% , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted . In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple 's own affair , and ca n't always be measured by a general yardstick .
ask.v | 2 | Common Cause %% asked %% both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him . Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency . Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
ask.v | 2 | `` The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . `` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also %% asked %% that he not be named . `` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . I think that 's less likely . ''

But everyone I met had sought cover first and %% asked %% questions later . And no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet Holes .

hour.n | 1 | A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why . While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows , variety %% hours %% , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts . One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions .

At a meeting Friday , the Kremlin leader complained about recent articles that raised the possiblity of civil unrest , and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by publishing stories about impending shortages . House-Senate conferees approved a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on flights of less than six %% hours %% to Alaska and Hawaii .

But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final %% hour %% -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos . Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
hour.n | 1 | CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one %% hour %% from its current 90 minutes . CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 . `` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August .
hour.n | 1 | Last week , Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter , saying that `` to my knowledge , Boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history .

In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas , Calif. , aerospace company . The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however .
hour.n | 1 | The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . An %% hour %% before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery .

occur.v | 1 | That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market . Typically , a margin call %% occurs %% when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities . But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
occur.v | 1 | Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have %% occurred %% . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .

The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals . Gulf Resources earlier this year %% proposed %% a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs . The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization .

With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are %% beginning %% to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .

begin.v | 1 | One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match . Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks %% begin %% . The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P.

The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement . A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives %% began %% Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia .

Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said . Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier %% began %% a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug .

Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles . The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which %% began %% officially Oct. 1 . This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level . Overall , sales of all domestic-made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago .

defense.n | 1 | The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments . Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position . Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the %% defense %% is permitted under state law . The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year . The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team .
part.n | 2 | GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come . Trading was muted in %% part %% because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe . Continued export demand also supported prices . As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
part.n | 1 | Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block . The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary . As %% part %% of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc. , a unit of Canada 's Trizec Corp . Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . '' He called today 's announcement `` opportunistic and disruptive '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
part.n | 2 | Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France . A U.S.-made imitation under the title `` Almost Anything Goes '' flopped fast . For the most %% part %% , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason . The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . Most British programming is more of an acquired taste .
part.n | 2 | Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday . And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines . Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his %% part %% , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered . If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg . `` If they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . ''
part.n | 1 | Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better . Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other %% parts %% of the economy and from other forms of housing ( such as low-income ) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense . More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink . The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .
part.n | 1 | Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices . Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . In %% parts %% of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn . Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa . It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .
part.n | 1 | Or so the slogan might go . American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card . The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or %% part %% of their down payments on the American Express green card . They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders . Neither company would disclose the program 's cost .
part.n | 2 | Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains . The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 . Buying for the most %% part %% carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said . According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits . However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
part.n | 2 | The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules . Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends . And that 's why the rules , for the most %% part %% , must stay in place , he says . Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed . But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .
part.n | 1 | Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell . But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % . For American Express , the promotion is %% part %% of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business . Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses . Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully { will be } the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . ''
part.n | 1 | Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as %% part %% of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho . In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which was a part-owner of the smelter , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program . The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals .
part.n | 1 | And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as %% part %% of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country . As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
part.n | 5 | On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points . Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek . In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a %% part %% , too , in Friday 's market activity .
part.n | 5 | That 's the problem , is n't it ? '' Indeed it is . Congress has said repeatedly it wants no %% part %% of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise . But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive . The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .
disclose.v | 1 | It would open a can of worms . '' Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either . After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation %% disclosed %% that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats . The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested . Now comes the pool flap .
disclose.v | 1 | The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley . Terms were n't %% disclosed %% , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually . Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . Valley Federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in Van Nuys .
come.v | 2 | Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied . With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . Worries about China %% came %% just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management . The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
come.v | 4 | Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop . It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90-pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season . However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to %% come %% out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound .
come.v | 2 | Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise %% came %% on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
come.v | 11 | Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . `` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . But we %% came %% into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` We 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' Friday . John Kenneth Galbraith .
come.v | 1 | When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing . `` They said , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters . That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has %% come %% since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world .
come.v | 11 | Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat-up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock . And it takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey . Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class-conscious Britain is n't ready to %% come %% to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free-enterprise regime . After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money . This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character .
come.v | 2 | Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital . But the Peugeot breakthrough %% came %% as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills . The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation . Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
come.v | 1 | Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox . It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall . Why does the national-service virus keep %% coming %% back ? Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel . If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
job.n | 2 | The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp. , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif . Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors . The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's %% job %% will be to obtain such approvals . The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad . `` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
job.n | 1 | And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . More than 42,000 %% jobs %% were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year . And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .
job.n | 1 | Only 26.8 % in October , compared with 28.5 % in September and 26.8 % in October 1988 , said income would increase . `` The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer 's day-to-day economic life , '' said Mr. Linden . `` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of %% job %% security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . '' The consumer confidence survey , covering 5,000 U.S. households , is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc. , a Toledo , Ohio , market researcher . Buying plans were mixed in October , with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months .
job.n | 1 | Or we might provide a tax credit for working students . What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill . To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial %% jobs %% in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? Not necessarily .
job.n | 1 | So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts . The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a %% job %% in television or journalism . The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .
job.n | 1 | Despite labor-shortage warnings , 80 % aim for first-year wage increases of under 4 % ; and 77 % say they 'd try to replace workers , if struck , or would consider it . TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations , the National Association of Temporary Services says ; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82 % with more than a high-school education , and 31 % with college degrees . About 12 % have retired from a full-time %% job %% , while 54 % were asked to stay on full time . HOME-SALE LOSSES rise , but they 're often covered by employers . But they search for ways to limit the damage .
job.n | 1 | There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family . Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit . When Ms. Evans took her %% job %% , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator . Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently . Mr. Bernstein , a tall , energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues .

But { otherwise } it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management . The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is %% believed %% to be Charles Saatchi . Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies . The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
believe.v | 1 | Similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , %% believing %% that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .
believe.v | 1 | Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls . A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate . Labor 's Visa card is %% believed %% to be the first linked to a British political party . Labor gets 25 pence ( 39 cents ) for every 100 ( about $ 155 ) that a user charges to the card . As with other plastic in Britain 's high-interest-rate environment , the Labor card , administered by Co-operative Bank , carries a stiff ( in this case , 29.8 % ) annual rate on the unpaid balance .

A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties . Information International said it %% believes %% that the complaints , filed in federal court in Georgia , are without merit . Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta , Ga .

When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' .

Named as defendants were Roland Matthews , president , and Peter Jonas , executive vice president and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager . The company said local %% authorities %% held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August . `` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court .

If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources said . Banks could seek to recover payments to local %% authorities %% in instances where the banks made net payments to councils . Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable . The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .

They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . Sen.

prove.v | 1 | Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to %% prove %% actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?

system.n | 2 | Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes . `` The guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines , '' said Mr. Benton . As a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses H-P , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based %% systems %% of their own . But they will have to act quickly . Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines .
system.n | 2 | `` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor . `` There was no panic . The %% system %% worked the way we devised it to work . '' After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into effect . Traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour .
system.n | 2 | Commenting on the results for the quarter , Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , noting that sales `` in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan . '' The company 's U.S. performance was helped by `` a record quarter for new customers , '' he said . Tandem makes `` fault-tolerant '' computers -- machines with built-in backup %% systems %% -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems . Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever , which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers . Tandem 's new high-end computer is called Cyclone .
system.n | 2 | Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels . During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered . That %% system %% is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks . One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school . `` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .
system.n | 4 | In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking %% system %% Monday morning . Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .
system.n | 2 | The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive . Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . In addition , many cable-TV %% systems %% themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations . CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits . Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research .
system.n | 1 | `` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark ( D. , Calif. ) , the bill 's chief sponsor . The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC . This financing %% system %% was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit . Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates . But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
system.n | 2 | Tony Cecin , head of equity trading at Piper , Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis , said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday . It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said . Joseph Hardiman , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading %% system %% , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . '' `` The pace of trading was orderly , '' he said . Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman .
system.n | 4 | These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later . In these four , for instance , the RTC is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets . Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch %% systems %% , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting . The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals . After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts .
system.n | 4 | Criminal charges were filed against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth , Calif. , facility . The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine , Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid , caustic and heavy metals into the sewer %% system %% , and stored hazardous materials in leaky , unlabeled or open-top containers . Named as defendants were Roland Matthews , president , and Peter Jonas , executive vice president and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager . The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August .
system.n | 2 | Nintendo Co. , a Japanese maker of video games , electronic information %% systems %% and playing cards , posted a 23 % unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen ( $ 429 million ) from 50 billion yen ( $ 349.9 million ) for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 . Sales surged 40 % to 250.17 billion yen from 178.61 billion . Net income rose 11 % to 29.62 billion yen from 26.68 billion .
system.n | 1 | And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers . When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda . Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing %% systems %% and to install circuit breakers . Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
system.n | 2 | Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically . I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . '' Under another post-crash %% system %% , Big Board President Richard Grasso ( Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling ) was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board . He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders . At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .
system.n | 2 | Hughes Aircraft Co. , a unit of General Motors Corp. , said it agreed to purchase the Electro-Optics Technology division of Perkin-Elmer Corp . Terms of the agreement were n't disclosed . But for the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1988 , the most recent period for which results were broken out , the Perkin-Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $ 145 million in sales recorded by the company 's government %% systems %% sector . Perkin-Elmer , which is based in Norwalk , Conn. , said the sale of the Danbury , Conn. , unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April . In addition to making electro-optical systems , the unit also makes laser warning receivers .
say.v | 1 | Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A. %% said %% group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit-sharing soared 97 % to 839 million francs ( $ 129.6 million ) in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier . The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts . It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U.S. News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine . Mr. Rosenblatt %% said %% he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington . `` Frankly , I missed my family , '' said Mr. Rosenblatt . In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly .
say.v | 1 | Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . '' Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . '' `` I think my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. Hills %% said %% at a news conference Saturday afternoon . `` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . I do n't feel very ferocious .
say.v | 1 | Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world %% said %% they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout . And they plan to buy more today . Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .
say.v | 2 | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit . The company did n't elaborate . The diversified energy and minerals concern %% said %% that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves . More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years . A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate .
say.v | 1 | While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high . And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts %% say %% . For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .
say.v | 1 | If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities . But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. %% said %% . Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said . Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers .
say.v | 1 | Pakistan 's Bhutto defeated the first no-confidence motion in the nation 's 42-year history , surviving the vote that could have brought down her 11-month-old government . The prime minister 's opponents claimed the balloting , 12 votes short of a majority in Islamabad 's 237-seat assembly , was rigged . The White House %% said %% the shipboard meetings next month between Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev will take place in the waters off Malta . The location was disclosed as the U.S. began planning the issues to be discussed at the Dec. 2-3 tete-a-tete . Bush unveiled a package of trade initiatives to help establish `` economic alternatives to drug trafficking '' in the Andean nations of South America .
say.v | 1 | `` That is a miracle . '' It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters ) . In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners %% say %% they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . '' `` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer . `` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
say.v | 1 | In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago . The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' %% says %% economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group , a Bala Cynwyd , Pa. , forecasting company . `` A lot of pent-up demand is gone . '' Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles .
say.v | 1 | Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . '' Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation . `` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he %% says %% . `` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . '' Peter Anthony , who runs an employment agency in New York , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .
say.v | 1 | The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said . Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . He %% said %% the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said . The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T .
say.v | 1 | Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures . Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft . A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank , Calif. , %% said %% he was n't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract .
say.v | 1 | I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month . '' Mr. Granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday . `` Most people , '' he %% says %% , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . '' Elaine Garzarelli . A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash .
say.v | 1 | At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million . Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high . Budget %% said %% its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level . Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to { frequent-flier programs } have significantly diminished their value . '' This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons .
say.v | 1 | The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year . Opponents of the cut are playing hardball . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) %% said %% he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . '' One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .
say.v | 1 | Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share . The year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million . The company %% said %% a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine-related operations . Also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts . Kysor , a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
say.v | 1 | Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV . `` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' %% says %% Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering ( and no relation to Ted Turner ) . `` You ca n't live on that . '' So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network .
say.v | 1 | The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , %% said %% Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago . For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat-growing portions of Kansas , he said .
say.v | 1 | But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group , the developer of Valley Ranch , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . '' Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch . `` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he %% says %% . `` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize .
say.v | 1 | Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . `` Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' %% said %% William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp . Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize . The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period .
say.v | 1 | Japan 's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball-parlor owners . The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese-style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics . Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen ( about $ 55,000 ) but %% said %% the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry . The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders . A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids .
say.v | 1 | Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes . Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests . Mr. Nesbit also %% said %% the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic . But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said . Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said .
say.v | 1 | Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August . Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion . But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts %% said %% . Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % . Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after dropping for three consecutive months .
say.v | 1 | White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . `` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said . House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) %% said %% in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . '' The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year . Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .
say.v | 1 | When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing . `` They %% said %% , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters . That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .
say.v | 1 | Budget said its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level . Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to { frequent-flier programs } have significantly diminished their value . '' This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , %% said %% Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . `` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | `` The economy , '' he added , `` remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' Sound familiar ? Here 's what Ronald Reagan %% said %% after the 1987 crash : `` The underlying economy remains sound . There is nothing wrong with the economy ... all the indices are up . '' Heard that before ?
say.v | 1 | Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued . `` The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' %% said %% Lawrence R. Mehl , Gulf 's general counsel . In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company . Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million .
say.v | 1 | Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts say . On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , %% said %% Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago . Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans .
say.v | 1 | Thousands of supporters , many brandishing flags of the outlawed African National Congress , gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country . Most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison . The 77-year-old Sisulu , sentenced to life in 1964 along with black nationalist Nelson Mandela for plotting to overthrow the government , %% said %% equality for blacks in South Africa was in reach . The releases , announced last week by President de Klerk , were viewed as Pretoria 's tacit legalization of the ANC . Mandela , considered the most prominent leader of the ANC , remains in prison .
say.v | 1 | `` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said . Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group . He also %% says %% he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month . He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases . Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units .
say.v | 1 | Sort of a two-step bear market . '' He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . `` That would be a normal bear market , '' he %% says %% . `` I guess that 's my forecast . '' Leon G. Cooperman .
say.v | 1 | Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association %% said %% Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo . The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
say.v | 1 | The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers , with a total value of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , between 1994 and 2004 . The aircraft would replace the T-37 , made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp. , which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots . Lockheed %% said %% the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp . Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures . Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft .
say.v | 1 | Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , %% said %% John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .
say.v | 1 | My advice is to buy . '' As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . She %% says %% that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' Ned Davis . Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc .
say.v | 1 | He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . `` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he %% said %% in a speech last month . He , like Justice Brennan , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars . Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents .
say.v | 1 | He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges . Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas . Aides %% say %% he continued to work the phones through the weekend . Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David .

Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said . Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , %% said %% he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers . He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . '' He added : `` We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility .
say.v | 1 | Nixon concluded five days of private talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing , but apparently failed to ease strains in Sino-U.S. ties caused by China 's crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in June . Beijing 's rulers complained to the former president about U.S. `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs . Mexico 's President Salinas %% said %% the country 's recession had ended and the economy was growing again . In his first state of the nation address , Salinas pledged to continue his program of modernization and warned opposition politicians that impeding progress could cost them popular support .

say.v | 1 | Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . This summer , on the other hand , had milder weather than usual . `` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' %% said %% Mr. Cox , Phillips 's president . `` The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . '' Going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 . They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products . But the Bush administration %% says %% it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization . To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft . The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . ''

say.v | 1 | Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale . Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money . `` The music has stopped playing , '' %% says %% Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins . `` You 've either got a chair or you do n't .

Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading . Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .
say.v | 1 | Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory . But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech . `` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he %% said %% . Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions .

Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug . The FDA has %% said %% it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin . Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically . He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically . He %% said %% that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa . Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language . As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .
say.v | 1 | Freed black nationalists resumed political activity in South Africa and vowed to fight against apartheid , raising fears of a possible white backlash . The nation 's main white opposition party warned that the government 's release Sunday of eight black political prisoners risked bringing chaos and eventual black Marxist rule to the nation . The White House %% said %% Bush is `` fully satisfied '' with CIA Director Webster and the intelligence agency 's performance during the Oct. 3 failed coup in Panama .

say.v | 1 | Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises . The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman . Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job-rating system they %% say %% fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
say.v | 1 | Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM\/UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington . `` It 's never really been tested , '' %% says %% William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies . Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy .
say.v | 1 | `` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins . `` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . '' In Friday 's aftermath , %% says %% R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . '' In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish .

say.v | 1 | Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp . Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end . The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company spokesman %% said %% . Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold . Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
say.v | 1 | `` Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she says . `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned .

say.v | 1 | The Nicaraguan president , citing attacks by the U.S.-backed rebels , suspended a 19-month-old cease-fire and accused Bush of `` promoting death . '' While he reaffirmed support for the country 's Feb. 25 elections , Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting . He %% said %% U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels . A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as `` deplorable '' but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents .

say.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $ 20 million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes . The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries . `` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , '' %% said %% Franklin President Duane H. Hall . `` I think it was a little premature on their part .
say.v | 1 | Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . Without him , %% said %% Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
say.v | 1 | Moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 . In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . `` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' %% says %% James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market . `` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest . Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
say.v | 1 | September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday . After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts %% said %% it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion .

say.v | 1 | Many called it simply a contrast in styles . But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . Others %% said %% the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade . Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration .

say.v | 1 | Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt . A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says . A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , it %% says %% , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York . A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
say.v | 1 | In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .

say.v | 1 | It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . '' Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away . `` The question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' %% said %% Mr. Heinemann . Time 's rivals news-weeklies , Washington Post Co.

Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .

say.v | 1 | Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago . For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat-growing portions of Kansas , he %% said %% . The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices . `` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice president , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago .

Richardson , a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain . Sports Unlimited , Tampa , Fla. , posted revenue of $ 59 million for the year ended July 31 . The company is `` very profitable '' on an operating basis , Mr. Richardson %% said %% , but he declined to specify numbers . In 1982 , Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie , Ill . In the latest transaction , management bought out the passive investors ' holding , Mr. Richardson said .

Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona . Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . I want to %% say %% in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . '' In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .

But the battle is more than Justin bargained for . `` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' %% says %% Mr. Kaye , who founded Justin in 1982 . Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored . With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios .

say.v | 1 | Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . Mr. Watkins %% said %% the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .
say.v | 1 | MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family . At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates . Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half %% said %% they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich .

say.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $ 165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift , citing turmoil in the market for low-grade , high-yield securities . The agency %% said %% it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade . Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds . New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years .
say.v | 1 | Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , %% said %% Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | However , Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers . For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , %% says %% Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch . `` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' '' Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever .
say.v | 1 | Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , %% said %% in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added . He did n't forecast Phillips 's results .
say.v | 1 | But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks . Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , %% said %% he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi . Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .

say.v | 1 | Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East . `` It 's very much a growing concern . But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he %% said %% . Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output . Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .
say.v | 1 | But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' %% said %% Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) . Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
say.v | 1 | The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute . Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group , sees benefits all around . The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he %% says %% . Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets . Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
say.v | 1 | It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team . `` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' %% says %% Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network . But that wo n't be easy . Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change .
say.v | 1 | Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and %% said %% it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future . Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November . The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .
say.v | 1 | Other works also have been exceeding price estimates . In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints . This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , %% says %% Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby 's . `` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says . Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector .
say.v | 1 | The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi . Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies . The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have %% said %% Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion . The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back . That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 .
say.v | 1 | Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , the magazine 's executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer . Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other . Mr. Zuckerman %% said %% his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles . Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor . The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .
say.v | 1 | `` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' Nevertheless , he %% says %% a depression does n't appear likely . `` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says . `` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
say.v | 1 | She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' Ned Davis . Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , %% says %% Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc . But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash . `` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says .
say.v | 1 | `` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . `` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' %% says %% William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York . Any sustained credit-easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale { for the junk bond rout } .
say.v | 1 | The Contra military command , in a statement from Honduras , said Sandinista troops had launched a major offensive against the rebel forces . East German leader Krenz called the protests in his country a `` good sign , '' saying that many of those marching for democratic freedoms were showing support for `` the renovation for socialism . '' The Communist Party chief , in Moscow for talks with Soviet officials , also %% said %% East Germany would follow Gorbachev 's restructuring plans . Thousands of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia after the East Berlin government lifted travel restrictions . The ban on cross-border movement was imposed last month after a massive exodus of emigres to West Germany .
say.v | 1 | Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . `` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' %% said %% Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc . That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter . While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse .
say.v | 1 | Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds . He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit . `` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie %% says %% . But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance . `` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
say.v | 1 | Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. . To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market . Kao officials previously have %% said %% they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker . It also has a product-testing facility in California . Some believe P&G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese .
say.v | 1 | `` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund . He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . `` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he %% says %% . Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much .
avoid.v | 1 | Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient 's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist . His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , %% avoided %% stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up to this point .
avoid.v | 1 | Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David . He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to %% avoid %% any sense of panic . Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day . And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning .
avoid.v | 1 | `` An L.A. solution , '' explains Mr. Friedman . Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it . Harry has %% avoided %% all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan . But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out . He 's a bore .
improve.v | 1 | The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may %% improve %% this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added .
improve.v | 1 | The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine %% improves %% with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good . If this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; ; it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk . A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .
improve.v | 1 | And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average . Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually %% improved %% in the past four years . Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .
attempt.v | 1 | The president 's plan includes a commitment to help negotiate a new international coffee agreement . Pan Am has subpoenaed several government agencies , including the CIA and FBI , to determine whether they were warned that a bomb had been planted aboard a jet that exploded over Scotland last December , killing 270 people . The airline is %% attempting %% to show that Israel and West Germany warned the U.S. about the impending attack . Died : James A. Attwood , 62 , retired chairman and president of Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York , Tuesday , in New York City , of an acute anemic condition .
attempt.v | 1 | As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable . The 1990 appropriations legislation %% attempts %% to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''
approve.v | 1 | In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the A[fj] . The board %% approved %% and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning . It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .
approve.v | 1 | Gorbachev blamed the Soviet Union 's press for contributing to the nation 's mounting problems . At a meeting Friday , the Kremlin leader complained about recent articles that raised the possiblity of civil unrest , and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by publishing stories about impending shortages . House-Senate conferees %% approved %% a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on flights of less than six hours to Alaska and Hawaii . The curbs would cover all but a small percentage of flights , and represent an expansion of the current ban on flights of less than two hours . E. Robert Wallach was sentenced by a U.S. judge in New York to six years in prison and fined $ 250,000 for his racketeering conviction in the Wedtech scandal .
recall.v | 1 | As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to %% recall %% how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors ' accounts .
recall.v | 1 | When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions . With loving detail she %% recalls %% her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist ( who rhymed river with liver in a love song ) ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good-will mission . '' They came by their strangeness honestly . Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` Philosophy for Women . ''
recall.v | 1 | Lucy was a lively part of the household . Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor . Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret %% recall %% , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' . There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother 's death occurred just as she was about to enter college . As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' .
build.v | 3 | Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts . The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism . The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to %% build %% audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program . It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .
build.v | 1 | A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids . Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $ 5 billion of business annually . A NATO project to %% build %% a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations . Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success . Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .

Here , at the Ravine Lodge , President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails . The Lodge , %% built %% of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room . The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country . The cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .
build.v | 1 | There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against %% building %% homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves . The key to the world of geology is change ; ; nothing remains the same . Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .
build.v | 1 | But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec . Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars . GM is studying whether it can %% build %% the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said . That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures . The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .
build.v | 1 | In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling . Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River . At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel %% built %% at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 . Its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier 's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River .

build.v | 2 | For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on %% building %% cooperation with other Europeans . The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H . In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership .
build.v | 1 | It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they %% built %% huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk 's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .
move.n | 2 | Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people , or 25 % of the staff . A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move . She said the %% move %% would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters . By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion . Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly , but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments .
move.n | 2 | A group of Arby 's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner 's control of the restaurant chain . The decision is the latest %% move %% in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August . At the time , a group called R.B. Partners Ltd. , consisting of eight of Arby 's largest franchisees , offered more than $ 200 million to buy Arby 's Inc. , which is part of DWG Corp . DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner .
move.n | 2 | Debt burdens are heavier . But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting %% moves %% to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
move.n | 2 | Time magazine , in a %% move %% to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways . In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 . In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 .
move.n | 2 | A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast . Several %% moves %% were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility . On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points . The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
move.n | 2 | Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations . The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper . But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a %% move %% that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms . Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co . `` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
move.n | 2 | Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , Texas , said it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million . The %% move %% boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern . Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp. , an Intelogic affiliate . The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company .
move.n | 2 | Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much . People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will . That %% move %% , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur . Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .
move.n | 2 | In the year-ago quarter , the natural gas concern had net income of $ 25.2 million , or 34 cents a share , on revenue of about $ 1.46 billion . Those results included a $ 2.7 million charge related to the retirement of debt . In a related %% move %% , Enron said it increased the number of the partnership 's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000 . The old and revised numbers both include over-allotment provisions . Enron said each unit will be priced in the $ 19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80 % of the partnership equity .

Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn . `` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors %% rush %% to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . `` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc .

What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
order.n | 6 | Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers . `` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said . Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' %% order %% for Scottish & Newcastle came in . For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette . On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
order.n | 2 | The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts . It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier . Still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the %% order %% of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year . For all of 1988 , Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs . The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings .
order.n | 6 | But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell . The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 . But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell %% orders %% left over from Friday 's late-afternoon rout . At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3\/4 to 117 . The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
order.n | 4 | On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts . Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 . The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the %% order %% , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision . Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger . That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
order.n | 6 | DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing . A faster version , the SuperDot , was launched in 1984 . Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , SuperDot handles about 80 % of all %% orders %% entered at the exchange . Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy ( for those who have purchased a contract ) or deliver ( for those who sold one ) a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date . Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due .
order.n | 6 | It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says . The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers . But grateful traders said the sell %% orders %% generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago . Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt . Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer .

order.n | 6 | At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3\/4 to 117 . The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble . More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy %% orders %% from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood . Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
order.n | 6 | -- United Auto Workers Local 1069 , which represents 3,000 workers at Boeing 's helicopter unit in Delaware County , Pa. , said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis , with a 10-day notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining . The accord expired yesterday . -- And Boeing on Friday said it received an %% order %% from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $ 326 million . The planes , long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet , will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney PW4060 engines . Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Inc .
do.v | 1 | Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . `` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to %% do %% some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` We 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' Friday . John Kenneth Galbraith .
do.v | 1 | `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said . The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . `` We hope that with what we %% did %% , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said . Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
do.v | 1 | Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much . Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to %% do %% today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go . He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . Frank Curzio .
do.v | 1 | Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced . But there 's disagreement over how to %% do %% it . Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through . But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
do.v | 1 | Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . '' A. Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading . Those who still want to %% do %% it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it . Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . '' Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .
do.v | 1 | In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance . Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar . The Treasury is %% doing %% the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987-style pressure . Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges . They are better capitalized .
do.v | 1 | The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush fails to %% do %% so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes . What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo . President Reagan learned that lesson .
do.v | 1 | Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds . He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit . `` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can %% do %% better , '' Mr. Robbie says . But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance . `` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
do.v | 2 | With a tax-free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year . Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . They would be %% doing %% better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped .
do.v | 1 | Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable . It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office . Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications %% did %% something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location . `` That is a miracle . '' It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters ) .
do.v | 1 | I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said . When it was suggested his comment was a `` non-answer , '' Mr. Darman replied : `` It is a non-answer . But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to %% do %% . '' At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop . `` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said .
do.v | 1 | Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn . That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator . Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was %% done %% in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''
start.v | 2 | Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money . Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . Prevention is best as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is %% started %% , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be . `` After your child 's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it 's time for that first dental appointment '' , Dr. Brodie advises . `` Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year '' .
start.v | 5 | After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families %% started %% the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States . In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling .
start.v | 2 | Hooker 's U.S. unit received a $ 409 million bid for most of its real-estate and shopping-center assets from an investor group . The offer does n't include Bonwit Teller or B. Altman . The Boeing strike is %% starting %% to affect airlines . America West said Friday it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from Boeing . Saatchi & Saatchi would launch a management buy-out if a hostile suitor emerged , an official said .
start.v | 3 | The ship was a Waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225 Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind . A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-12 feet long , the Waco was entered to compete in the `` On-to-Spokane '' Air Derby of 1927 . As a matter of fact , Fogg and his plane did n't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he %% started %% subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers . So with all this experience , Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract . His work began just six days after the flood .
start.v | 2 | Like hell he 'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ? What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ? ? Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2 Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1 William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to %% start %% shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette . Below decks , Seaman 1 Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home . Above decks on the John Harvey , Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .
start.v | 2 | As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes . Worse , Congress has %% started %% to jump on the Skinner bandwagon . James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .
start.v | 2 | It will continue to trade on the International Stock Exchange , London . The American Stock Exchange listed shares of two companies . AIM Telephones Inc. , a Parsippany , N.J. , telecommunications equipment supply company , %% started %% trading with the symbol AIM . It had traded over-the-counter . Columbia Laboratories Inc. , Miami , began trading with the symbol COB .
network.n | 2 | RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying %% network %% advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta . A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money . The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson .
network.n | 2 | That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job . The %% network %% 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force . CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks . Says Mr. Mosettig : `` CNN is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything .
network.n | 2 | Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location . `` That is a miracle . '' It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the %% network %% , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters ) . In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . '' `` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer .
network.n | 2 | CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes . CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the %% network %% 's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972 . `` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August . `` This will raise the energy level of the show . ''
network.n | 2 | CNN 's viewer habits have been molded by its format . Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service . It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other %% networks %% . It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows .
network.n | 2 | `` It 's never really been tested , '' says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies . Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a %% network %% from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy . Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake .
network.n | 2 | If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . Under current rules , even when a %% network %% fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations . Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
network.n | 2 | CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits . Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research . That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast %% networks %% . The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels . CNN 's viewer habits have been molded by its format .
network.n | 2 | One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies . The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the %% networks %% ' upcoming season . `` The studies { on closing the unit } could n't be completed until now , '' he said . The group 's president , Peter Chrisanthopoulos , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment .
network.n | 2 | It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies . Now , the %% network %% has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital . Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe . `` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .
network.n | 2 | `` They said , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters . That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast %% networks %% . Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world . But for all its success , CNN has hit a plateau .
regard.v | 1 | It can , in fact , wreck a marriage . When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her . And she begins to %% regard %% him as savage , bestial and unworthy . On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity . He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .
regard.v | 1 | `` I want to show respect for my parents ' religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism . Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I 'll be living in a suburb '' . Intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival , was %% regarded %% not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds . `` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' .
go.v | 1 | `` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says . `` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing . On the other hand , if it %% goes %% way sky high , I always sell . You do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .
go.v | 7 | `` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel . John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . We are n't %% going %% to change agencies because of a change in London . '' Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they saw no effect . Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment .
go.v | 1 | This may sound strangely optimistic . After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . When it %% went %% down , by all tradition , the economy followed . That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz .
go.v | 1 | But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country . As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . As the days %% go %% by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
go.v | 7 | It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . Brazilian juice , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities . Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is %% going %% to be in plentiful supply . The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen . It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said .
go.v | 1 | If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . '' Frank W. Terrizzi . Stock prices `` would still have to %% go %% down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati . Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills .
go.v | 7 | `` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` We 're %% going %% to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' Friday . John Kenneth Galbraith . `` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. Galbraith , an economist .
go.v | 7 | Mario Gabelli . New York money manager Mario Gabelli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone . `` Companies are still %% going %% to buy companies around the world , '' he says . Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue .
go.v | 7 | In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion . Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry . `` For the next few years , like it or not , China is %% going %% to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border . In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia . Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
go.v | 1 | To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots . Things had just %% gone %% too far . '' Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken .
go.v | 1 | `` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice president , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago . Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will %% go %% .

share.n | 2 | But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said . By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their %% shares %% . `` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . `` What we had was a real , old-fashioned rally . ''
share.n | 2 | In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Rocha Garza said Biscayne Syndicate Inc. , Lahus II Inc. , and Lahus III Inc. bought the 600,000 shares on Oct. 11 for $ 1.4 million , or $ 2.375 a share .

share.n | 2 | Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition . `` The ( strong ) dollar hurt Pfizer a lot , too , '' Mr. Sweig said . In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ 216.8 million , or $ 1.29 a %% share %% . In New York , the company declined comment . Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago .
share.n | 1 | THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 .

share.n | 2 | Mr. McGovern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented . `` New managers would think a little more like Wall Street , '' Mr. McMillin added . Some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation , which has contributed to volatility of Campbell %% shares %% in recent months . Campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K. and Italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems . Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units .
share.n | 2 | Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a shade . Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares . Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a %% share %% and $ 3.30 a share , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion . A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates . At the investment firm of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8 % to 10 % .
share.n | 2 | But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share . In the 1988 third quarter , Quantum earned $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . Another big polyethylene producer , Union Carbide Corp. , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a %% share %% and $ 1.25 , compared with $ 1.56 a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ 213 million on sales of $ 2.11 billion . Himont , Quantum and Union Carbide all declined to comment .

Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a %% share %% .

share.n | 2 | Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction . Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred %% share %% with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding . Previously , it offered $ 13.65 a share in cash , or $ 29 million . The El Paso , Texas , maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12 % rate , but would n't be paid for the first two years .
share.n | 2 | Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . '' Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off . Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their %% shares %% . `` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . But not everybody was making money .
share.n | 2 | Nissan Motor Co. , Japan 's second-largest car maker , announced Wednesday that the parent concern 's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14 % to 88.32 billion yen ( $ 618.1 million ) from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier . Nissan cited strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion . Profit surged 42 % to 40.21 billion yen , or 16.09 yen a share , from 28.36 billion yen , or 11.72 yen a %% share %% . Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen , climbing 17 % from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period . Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment , unchanged .
share.n | 2 | Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on %% shares %% of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd . The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp . Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million ( US$ 8 million ) of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday .
share.n | 2 | Security Pacific Corp . Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans . Net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a %% share %% , a year earlier . The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans ( mainly residential ) , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease .
share.n | 2 | Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut . The real value of all %% shares %% , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
share.n | 2 | Memotec said the agreement calls for it to make a $ 20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of ISI . But it said Charles Johnston , ISI chairman and president , agreed to sell his 60 % stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash , Memotec stock and debentures . Memotec said the tender offer is conditioned on , among other things , holders tendering at least 15 % of the %% shares %% outstanding , other than the shares held by Mr. Johnston . ISI said its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid . ISI said it can withdraw from the merger agreement with Memotec if a better bid surfaces .

For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a %% share %% , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share . This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations . Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .
share.n | 2 | In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % . But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings . When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a %% share %% , provided no other variables are changing . In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
share.n | 2 | NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .

In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a %% share %% , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier . Security Pacific Corp . Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
share.n | 2 | Then exhilaration . Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 . It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 %% shares %% -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash . While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .
share.n | 2 | @ Charles H. Tenney II , chairman of Unitil Corp. , purchased 34,602 %% shares %% , or 4.9 % , of Unitil 's common , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . The stock was bought on Thursday in a privately negotiated transaction , the filing said . As previously reported , Unitil , Exeter , N.H. , and Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co. , Fitchburg , Mass. , are targets of unsolicited tender offers from Boston-based Eastern Utilities Associates .
share.n | 2 | But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat . `` When you see a runaway train , '' says Steve Janachowski , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell %% shares %% gradually during rallies . The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion . On the one hand , Mr. Front says , it would be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . ''
share.n | 2 | Harry Millis , an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland , said GenCorp 's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas , run by a private subcontractor , that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp 's Aerojet Ordnance business . Transamerica Corp. , San Francisco , said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier . The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1 % to $ 93.9 million , or $ 1.19 a %% share %% , compared with $ 92.9 million , or $ 1.18 a share , the year earlier . The results reflected a 24 % gain in income from its finance businesses , and a 15 % slide in income from insurance operations . Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $ 10.2 million , compared with $ 6.4 million the year earlier .
share.n | 2 | Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear , Stearns & Co. , the investment banking and brokerage firm . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Bear Stearns shares closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents . Separately , PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $ 16.8 million , or 41 cents a %% share %% , reflecting a `` broad-based improvement '' in the company 's core businesses . Retail profit surged , but the company said it was only a `` modest contributor '' to third-quarter results .

share.n | 2 | The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination . Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments . Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a %% share %% , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share . Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .

share.n | 2 | The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production . Not everything looks grim for Quantum . The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market %% share %% is often taken through sheer capacity . By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs . Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing .
share.n | 2 | The sale represents 10.2 % of Meridian 's shares outstanding . The McAlpine family , which operates a number of multinational companies , including a London-based engineering and construction company , also lent to Meridian National $ 500,000 . That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $ 2 a %% share %% during its one-year term . The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $ 2.50 a share . The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey , England and a recent public offering have increased Meridian 's net worth to $ 8.5 million , said William Feniger , chief executive officer of Toledo , Ohio-based Meridian .
share.n | 2 | Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so . Shares of American Medical International , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago , fell 15.8 % on Friday to close at 20 . The buy-out group is offering $ 26.50 a share for 63 million American Medical %% shares %% , down from its offer in July of $ 28 a share for 68.8 million shares . But investment bankers say the market may have oversold some takeover-related stocks . Hilton Hotels , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling 20.2 % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on Friday .
share.n | 2 | Investment banking revenue climbed 25 % , while commission revenue advanced 31 % on a stronger retail market . Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear , Stearns & Co. , the investment banking and brokerage firm . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Bear Stearns %% shares %% closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents . Separately , PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $ 16.8 million , or 41 cents a share , reflecting a `` broad-based improvement '' in the company 's core businesses .

The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a %% share %% . Revenue gained 5.3 % to $ 404.1 million from $ 383.8 million . The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
share.n | 2 | `` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors . That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , '' said Norbert Braeuer , a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank . Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up lower-priced %% shares %% late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting . But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8 . Some of West Germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits .
share.n | 2 | PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share . In the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ 326,000 , or four cents a %% share %% , on revenue of about $ 41.4 million .

share.n | 2 | A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ 18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . '' In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the %% shares %% outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low .

The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 %% share %% , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday .

Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding .
share.n | 2 | A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp. , New York , after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction , the companies said .

share.n | 2 | Sales rose more than 7 % to $ 94.9 million from $ 88.3 million . The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .

share.n | 2 | In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .

For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a %% share %% .

Mr. Rocha Garza said that he , Clarendon Group Ltd. , Biscayne , Lahus II , and Lahus III are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares , or 9.33 % . Mr. Rocha Garza has said he wants to purchase more shares .
share.n | 2 | The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa . The suit claimed Apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ 63.50 a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . But when the company revealed Lisa 's poor sales late in 1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ 17.37 a %% share %% , according to the suit . The shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million in losses . In 1987 , the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by alerting consumers to Lisa 's problems .
share.n | 2 | In the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply . For Himont Inc. , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers . The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a %% share %% to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ 107.8 million on sales of $ 435.5 million . Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . The company , based in Wilmington , Del. , is 81%-owned by Montedison S.p . A. , Milan , which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares it does n't already own .

The firm , which was acquired in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ 56.4 million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees . Though the offering did n't sell out , James J. Didion , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` We 're pretty proud of the employees ' response . ''

But even among those aged 75 and older , the %% share %% living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives .

policy.n | 1 | Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary %% policy %% , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . `` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .
policy.n | 1 | Encouraging long-term investing . We must be very cautious about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . '' %% Policies %% designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! '' The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term . A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
policy.n | 1 | The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . `` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . '' -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic %% policy %% . The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting . `` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
policy.n | 1 | `` That did not happen . They learned they could survive it without much problem . '' But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal %% policy %% . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .

As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .
policy.n | 1 | `` We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter . More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash . Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government %% policy %% makers would allay investor fears . It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says . The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .
policy.n | 1 | But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover %% policy %% was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash . Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .
kill.v | 1 | In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay . A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . In 1896 a Japanese tsunami %% killed %% 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes . The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement . An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific .

kill.v | 1 | In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern 's Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out . He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper 's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to %% kill %% from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O'Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .
receive.v | 1 | Another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading . Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual . Not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of %% receiving %% messages from the deceased . In fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .

receive.v | 1 | All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever %% receives %% takes place while the chef is preparing the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .
receive.v | 1 | He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ; ; it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! ! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious '' moods and to clarify them . However , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not %% receive %% a personal reading . Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing . For this was to be a `` proxy sitting '' .

The Boeing strike is starting to affect airlines .
receive.v | 1 | As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive . Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` New Research On Survival After Death '' , Spring 1958 ) . He remarked : `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was %% received %% telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' . The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .
receive.v | 1 | With these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco , Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21 , 1927 . Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches . During the second week of operations , Fogg %% received %% a telegram from the Post Office Department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip '' . Since Fogg 's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions . Over the weeks , America 's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .
allow.v | 1 | Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . %% Allowing %% the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
allow.v | 1 | But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas . Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to %% allow %% commercial television alongside its state channels . The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. .
allow.v | 1 | Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably %% allowed %% to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted . Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy . For , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .

Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . When served in a psychological atmosphere that %% allows %% young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities . Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands . These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .
allow.v | 1 | The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward . Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment . Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to %% allow %% the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .

allow.v | 1 | What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are %% allowed %% to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point .

The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was %% working %% as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .

work.v | 9 | In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems %% work %% out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .

Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . '' The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to %% cause %% irreparable damage to the Arby 's system . We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings .
cause.v | 1 | Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was `` the sorest grief '' the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear . The daughters of Spelman , she said , had never known or thought of Spelman without her . The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had %% caused %% them great sorrow , but they still had Miss Giles . Now the school was indeed bereft . `` Yet Spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come '' .
cause.v | 1 | All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods . Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates . Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , %% causing %% the index to decline for three consecutive months . Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said . While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 .
cause.v | 1 | A few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders . He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie . It was obviously the sound of this argument that %% caused %% Lizzie to close her door . The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse , he would have convicted `` somebody '' . Notice , Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden .
cause.v | 1 | The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman . That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily %% cause %% all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological . Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .
cause.v | 1 | Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous . The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had %% caused %% Lincoln to become insolvent . Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 .
cause.v | 1 | Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that %% causes %% him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann 's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .
cause.v | 1 | Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before . Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets . The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge %% caused %% some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. . Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years . The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar .
cause.v | 1 | What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ? When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual . `` To be creative is to have the ability to %% cause %% to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed . Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .
power.n | 2 | The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding . This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report . As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of %% powers %% . It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution . The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes .

power.n | 1 | Poland 's legislature approved limits on automatic wage increases without special provisions for food price rises . The vote was considered a test of the Solidarity-led government 's resolve to proceed with a harsh economic-restructuring program . Norway 's King Olav V installed a three-party non-Socialist government as Gro Harlem Brundtland 's three-year-old Labor regime relinquished %% power %% . The 19-member cabinet is led by Prime Minister Jan Syse , who acknowledged a `` difficult situation '' since the coalition controls only 62 seats in Oslo 's 165-member legislature . El Salvador 's government opened a new round of talks with the country 's leftist rebels in an effort to end a decade-long civil war .
power.n | 3 | `` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific . Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program . `` We 're certainly looking at some %% power %% generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator . Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .
power.n | 1 | By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such %% power %% . However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution . The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
power.n | 1 | Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered . So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain %% power %% , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated . First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece . Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .
power.n | 1 | Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a %% power %% of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
power.n | 1 | Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other . Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive %% power %% than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . '' This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
power.n | 2 | If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration . But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now . Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of %% powers %% works in practice . As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down . President Bush should set things straight .
space.n | 2 | Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail %% space %% vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords . It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp .
space.n | 2 | In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . `` There is an unbelievable amount of %% space %% available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc . There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . `` This further confuses retailers , '' she says .
prepare.v | 2 | Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was %% prepared %% to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
prepare.v | 2 | Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay . Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was %% preparing %% to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 .
prepare.v | 1 | All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is %% preparing %% the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .
explain.v | 1 | He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he %% explained %% . Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models .
explain.v | 1 | In March there was a division of the slaves , and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible . Of the fifty-two slaves , Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females . `` I considered that your views would be best carried out '' , he %% explained %% , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation . I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice '' . The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .
explain.v | 1 | In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to %% explain %% , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler 's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .
people.n | 1 | Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows . Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China . `` Singapore took the hit because when %% people %% want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities ( Hong Kong ) Ltd . She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably . Similarly , Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close .
people.n | 1 | Hours after the announcement , representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting . The reaction in the newsroom was emotional . `` I 've never seen so many %% people %% crying in one place at one time , '' said Bill Johnson , an assistant city editor . `` So Long , L.A. '' was chosen as the paper 's final headline . `` I 'm doing the main story , and I 'm already two beers drunk , '' said reporter Andy Furillo , whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference .
people.n | 1 | In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur . %% People %% are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward . The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
people.n | 2 | He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan . But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese %% people %% that we 're moving in earnest . '' How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months . American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .
people.n | 1 | He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager 's post had n't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization . Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters 's eight-person executive committee who did n't also serve on the company 's board of directors . `` If I were choosing the people of tomorrow , I would have chosen the %% people %% who are now on the board , '' he said . A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . '' Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London , said , `` I suspect ( the departure ) will be fairly irrelevant for the company .
people.n | 1 | `` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said . The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market . This raises the key issue : What to do about %% people %% who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ? We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone . As liability expert Peter Huber tells us , after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . ''
people.n | 1 | `` I did n't bother calling anybody ; I did n't even turn on TV . '' `` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added John Smale , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 . `` The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives %% people %% some comfort that this wo n't be a problem . '' Of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists . Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump .
people.n | 1 | Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ? Youth only or all ages ? Middle-class %% people %% , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ? Many or few ? Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
people.n | 1 | The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of { the good will } has been written off . '' Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much . %% People %% close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will . That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .

'' For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours . By lunchtime , the selling was at near-panic fever .
people.n | 2 | But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American %% people %% -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) . Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
people.n | 1 | He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . Frank Curzio . Many %% people %% now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board .
people.n | 1 | Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product . Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up . `` %% People %% were even hoarding bags , '' he says . Now producers hope prices have hit bottom . They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks .
people.n | 1 | Potential bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says Mr. Rattner of Lazard . `` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a 200-point drop in the Dow , '' Mr. Rattner says . `` Just as there are %% people %% waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market , there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market . '' Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well-heeled corporations . `` In the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to outbid '' the corporations , says J. Tomilson Hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
people.n | 1 | Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure . The company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . '' But %% people %% familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired . Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991 , `` unless I get fired . '' Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for Nov. 17 .
people.n | 1 | Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement ( Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 ) , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things . Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million %% people %% working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ? Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador . Frank Tremdine
people.n | 1 | I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz . That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer . But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other %% people %% '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America . At your age , Jackie , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .
people.n | 1 | Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying . The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of Across the country , many %% people %% took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general . Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks . I much prefer money I can put my hands on . ''
people.n | 1 | But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed . Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young %% people %% providing those services alter the calculation . Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .
people.n | 1 | Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts . Some in the industry are skeptical . `` I find it hard to conceive of %% people %% switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report . The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC .
people.n | 1 | If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving . A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft . Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young %% people %% is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion . Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft . But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .
people.n | 1 | Harry fondly remembers the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong . `` An L.A. solution , '' explains Mr. Friedman . Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way %% people %% size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it . Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan . But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out .

Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables . With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` %% people %% do n't want to just sit around and drink . '' Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop .

lead.v | 1 | The assistant HHS secretary said the ban `` should be continued indefinitely . '' While researchers believe such transplants could help treat diseases like Alzheimer 's , anti-abortionists oppose the research . Rep. Dingell of Michigan plans to unveil today a proposal that would break with Bush 's clean-air bill on the issue of emissions that %% lead %% to acid rain . The Democrat 's proposal is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the president 's plan to cut utility emissions . House-Senate conferees approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland .
lead.v | 4 | He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade . There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded . He could %% lead %% a patrol and he knew his paper work . Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army 's correspondence courses . He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .
lead.v | 6 | One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost . This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually %% lead %% their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class Jewish student . There is , to begin , an important sex difference .
lead.v | 1 | She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Do n't rock the boat '' . Sometimes this %% leads %% to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area . More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .
lead.v | 1 | Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August . Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would %% lead %% to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . `` I think the resurgence { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide .
lead.v | 1 | The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding . The exchange ratio was never established . Weatherford said market conditions %% led %% to the cancellation of the planned exchange . The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .
lead.v | 3 | The ship 's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole . As the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay , an inlet of the Great Strait . After finding that its coasts %% led %% nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled . The trouble was at least partly Juet 's doing . For weeks he had been saying that Hudson 's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd .

Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period . Income from %% sources %% other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities . `` These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related '' income , the bank said . Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million .

source.n | 3 | In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome . According to diplomatic %% sources %% in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 . The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency . But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
source.n | 3 | Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out . Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share . Market %% sources %% said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock . But the exact amount of Reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed . The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .
replace.v | 1 | Measuring cups may soon be %% replaced %% by tablespoons in the laundry room . Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload . The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds .

He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings . In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to %% replace %% arched openings on the G Street Bridge . Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below . In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park .
replace.v | 1 | If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said . Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market . But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to %% replace %% Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks . Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .

Now kindred spirits on Addison 's town council have barred the town 's fanciest hotel , the Grand Kempinski , from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge . Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about %% setting %% a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street . And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that `` alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights . '' The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years .

Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and %% set %% fire to the American Embassy next door . What had been the ambassador 's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11 , 1960 ) .
set.v | 4 | The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe . Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable . It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to %% set %% up office . Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location . `` That is a miracle .

It was the night of December 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in Bari . It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .

After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century . `` Circuit breakers '' %% set %% to soften big drops : -- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes . -- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes .
set.v | 5 | Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice . As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down . President Bush should %% set %% things straight . If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . '' Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration .
set.v | 3 | The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years . The index , which registered 156.8 at the end of September , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted . Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , outstripping both the initial 3 % inflation goal %% set %% by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % .
set.v | 4 | He gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator . As always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter . So this proxy situation has %% set %% up at least a partial barrier between the medium 's ESP and the absent sitter 's mind . It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range . Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .
raise.v | 2 | The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson 's sworn enemies . As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew 's respect for him . Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor %% raised %% before the sea had calmed . Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship . Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .

Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .

'' CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour . But CBS News will extend its four-hour `` Nightwatch '' by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m .
raise.v | 4 | The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion . Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to %% raise %% capital . During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit . Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .
raise.v | 3 | And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely %% raised %% an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chances ? ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .
raise.v | 6 | Secretary of State Baker , in a foreign policy speech , called for the reunification of Germany , saying it was the `` legitimate right '' of the German people . Gorbachev blamed the Soviet Union 's press for contributing to the nation 's mounting problems . At a meeting Friday , the Kremlin leader complained about recent articles that %% raised %% the possiblity of civil unrest , and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by publishing stories about impending shortages . House-Senate conferees approved a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on flights of less than six hours to Alaska and Hawaii . The curbs would cover all but a small percentage of flights , and represent an expansion of the current ban on flights of less than two hours .
exist.v | 1 | When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual . `` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously %% existed %% . Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character . All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .
exist.v | 1 | The actions of Bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence . There are also other factors that require closer examination . The legend as it %% exists %% in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut . The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie . If Bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden .
exist.v | 1 | It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may %% exist %% in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales , Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition .
exist.v | 1 | In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl . She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object . Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may %% exist %% that need special gynecological treatment . It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation . When no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .
contribute.v | 1 | One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably %% contributed %% more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud 's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .
contribute.v | 1 | Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . According to the Gallup Poll , American adults %% contribute %% an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % ( adjusted for inflation ) . Even if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them . If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service .

A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations . Britain , France and Italy %% announced %% technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success . Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls . A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate .
announce.v | 1 | Hoping to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized . He is not likely to win this battle easily . In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to %% announce %% that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to `` hustle '' it out of Washington . The last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to Taras Shevchenko , the Ukrainian poet laureate ; ; eleven others were introduced . Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac , and TR.

announce.v | 1 | The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements . The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . The transaction , %% announced %% in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley . Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually . Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
announce.v | 1 | `` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added . Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models . Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices %% announced %% earlier this fall . At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle . a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
promise.v | 2 | The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies . One by one , the openings in the coast that %% promised %% a passage through had been explored and discarded . In fact , Hudson 's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes . But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .
purchase.v | 1 | While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . Accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson 's Bay Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be %% purchased %% and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson 's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company 's trade and power '' .
purchase.v | 1 | In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer , Royal Trustco Ltd. , Toronto , will acquire Pacific Savings Bank , Costa Mesa , Calif. , which had $ 949 million in assets . Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits . It will also %% purchase %% $ 473 million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the RTC .

It now serves the President in his oval office . Later , browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Des Beaux-Arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table %% purchased %% in 1817 by President James Monroe . She traced it to a storage room . With its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House .
point.n | 14 | It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 %% points %% . Just a coincidence ? Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?
point.n | 14 | Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in . For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette . On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few %% points %% and was off about 140 . `` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said . He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
point.n | 14 | Dealers led the market Wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts , observers said . Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar . The Tokyo Stock Price Index ( Topix ) of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 16.05 %% points %% Tuesday , was down 1.46 points , or 0.05 % , at 2691.19 . The Second Section index , which added 6.84 points Tuesday , was up 5.92 points , or 0.16 % , to close at 3648.82 . Volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares , up from 14 million Tuesday .
point.n | 14 | GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says . Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC . These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage %% point %% off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts . A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link . Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .
point.n | 14 | Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 . The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday . In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 %% points %% , to 35133.83 . By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally . Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
point.n | 14 | So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start . The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading . But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 %% points %% , then drifted lower , closing down 647 . Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out . In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process .

point.n | 4 | No one can say for sure what will happen today . And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . But they 're nearly unanimous on one %% point %% : Do n't sell into a panic . Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it . Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago .
point.n | 14 | If I sell now , I 'll take a big loss . '' Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987 . `` Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 %% points %% on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky . Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . '' At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis , the scene was calm .
point.n | 14 | LONDON : Headed toward a record drop at midday , the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York 's early rally . The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off 70.5 %% points %% , at 2163.4 , its high for the day , after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m . It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group , Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally . Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board .
point.n | 14 | Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell . But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . Junk bonds opened as much as four %% points %% lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed . Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying . In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .

The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders . On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 %% points %% from the previous day 's close for half an hour . If , when trading resumes , the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading halt takes effect . Also , the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day .
point.n | 14 | Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . `` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work , '' the company said . Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage %% points %% to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R. Wayne Atwell , an analyst with Goldman , Sachs & Co . Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's slowest , Mr. Atwell added , `` the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway . '' Nevertheless , the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000 , buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline .
point.n | 14 | At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers . By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 %% points %% , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened . But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around . It ended with a gain of 88.12 points .
point.n | 4 | And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it . On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . Two years ago , about the only %% point %% of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression . The doomsayers had a receptive audience . The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today .
point.n | 14 | Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained . And many arbitragers , already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed . Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 %% points %% , its second-worst drop in history . World-wide , trading was generally manageable . The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % .

point.n | 14 | The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 %% point %% drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
point.n | 5 | The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 to close at $ 75.50 a share . Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms . `` It 's hard to know what to expect at this %% point %% , '' said Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co . `` The industry defies characterization . '' To illustrate , Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results .
point.n | 14 | Tokyo stocks edged up Wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading . London shares finished moderately higher . At Tokyo , the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues , which gained 132 %% points %% Tuesday , added 14.99 points to 35564.43 . In early trading in Tokyo Thursday , the Nikkei index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64 . Wednesday 's volume on the First Section was estimated at 900 million shares , in line with Tuesday 's 909 million .
point.n | 14 | `` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . '' But stocks kept falling . The Dow industrials were down 55 %% points %% at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply .
point.n | 14 | The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans ( mainly residential ) , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease . As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis %% points %% , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings . Security Pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading . The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity .
point.n | 14 | THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . The Dow Jones industrials closed up 88.12 %% points %% , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after being down as much as 63.52 points in the morning . The rally erased about half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , but analysts are cautious about the market 's outlook . The dollar also rebounded , while bond prices plummeted and Treasury bill rates soared .
point.n | 14 | At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index . Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks . Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 %% points %% , or 7 % . `` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office . The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk .

point.n | 14 | An appeal is expected . In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session . Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 %% point %% lower . The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion ) , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals . At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .

Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill . The House appears reluctant to %% join %% the senators . A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions . `` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate .

management.n | 2 | Midwest Financial has $ 2.3 billion in assets and eight banks . The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990 , when each will adopt the First of America name . Kalamazoo , Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 %% management %% positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company . First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America . But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America 's operating results for 1989 by $ 3 million to $ 4 million , or 15 cents to 20 cents a share .
management.n | 2 | Individuals can always have their hands slapped . It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble . I do not by any means defend HUD %% management %% .

The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... .

state.n | 2 | The president , at a news conference Friday , also renewed a call for the ouster of Panama 's Noriega . The White House said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . The administration 's policy was stated in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to give %% states %% more leeway to restrict abortions . Ten of the nation 's governors , meanwhile , called on the justices to reject efforts to limit abortions . The Justice Department announced that the FBI has been given the authority to seize U.S. fugitives overseas without the permission of foreign governments .
state.n | 2 | The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions . Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a %% state %% to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 .
state.n | 2 | Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again . At the same time , several %% states %% in the South and West have had their own population turnaround . Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska . Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue .
state.n | 2 | The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give %% states %% more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect . He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
state.n | 2 | The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute . Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group , sees benefits all around . The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the %% state %% , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says . Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets . Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
state.n | 2 | In addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills . The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing . Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting %% states %% who insist on cost-sharing . It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan . While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .
state.n | 2 | But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas . Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its %% state %% channels . The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. .

state.n | 2 | Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . Six of the 12 midwestern %% states %% have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin . The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race . Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s .
state.n | 2 | In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users . The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used . Beginning in 1980 , courts in several %% states %% including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales . This has some logic .
state.n | 2 | This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative . If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly . The initiative creates a free floating %% state %% environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like . That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost . Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
state.n | 2 | Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. %% states %% where Farmers operates . The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers . In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .
state.n | 2 | Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production . The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually . It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to %% states %% and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless . Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .
state.n | 2 | Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California . We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the %% state %% 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ? If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .

Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day .
position.n | 2 | Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect . He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents . The administration 's %% position %% was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term . The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .
position.n | 2 | President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week . Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities . Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the %% position %% of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . `` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies .
position.n | 4 | At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants . While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party . Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire %% position %% . Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk . The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal .
position.n | 4 | Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . The nation 's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short %% positions %% had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . All that now has changed . `` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach .
position.n | 2 | The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the %% position %% Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . '' The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound . In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .
position.n | 3 | They said the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better . `` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. Phelan said after the market closed . `` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme %% position %% , worked extremely well . '' Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said . While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash .
see.v | 2 | American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills . Many called it simply a contrast in styles . But some %% saw %% it as a classic negotiating tactic . Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade .
see.v | 2 | Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it . Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds . He did n't %% see %% why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit . `` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says . But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
see.v | 2 | A. Donald Anderson , a 59-year-old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading . Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it . Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't %% see %% that it does anything for the market or the country . '' Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation . `` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says .
see.v | 2 | But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . `` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . `` The other is that we %% see %% another major disaster , like two years ago . I think that 's less likely . '' Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
see.v | 3 | When a regional economy catches cold , the local real-estate market gets pneumonia . In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession . This was %% seen %% in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York . But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
see.v | 2 | If you 're a technician , you obey the signals . Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out . I %% see %% no major support until 2200 . I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month . '' Mr. Granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday .

see.v | 3 | Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . `` We could %% see %% higher oil prices this year , '' said Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc . That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter . While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse .
see.v | 3 | John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London . '' Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they %% saw %% no effect . Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment . Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him .

Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . Officials at Drexel said they had n't %% seen %% the suit and thus could n't comment . In addition to $ 33 million compensatory damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages . Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels .
development.n | 3 | They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment . The company and its executives deny the charges . In a related %% development %% , Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days . The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since . The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
development.n | 3 | But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime . In separate %% developments %% : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas , Calif. , aerospace company . The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
development.n | 1 | Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 . That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines . The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization %% development %% program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts . For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 . Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .
development.n | 1 | The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp. , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif . Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors . The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for %% development %% , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals . The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad . `` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
development.n | 3 | And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $ 300 a share . Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL %% developments %% , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy . Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL 's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks . After UAL , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines ' parent AMR , the target of a $ 120-a-share takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump .
report.v | 1 | That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense . A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $ 300 to let it through . One of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and %% reported %% the situation . O'Banion 's reaction was : `` Three hundred dollars ! ! To them bums ? ?
report.v | 3 | Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it . Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was %% reporting %% for duty as commanding officer of Troop H , 7th Cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot . First of all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside , especially when he 's an armchair trooper .
report.v | 1 | Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department %% reported %% Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . `` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .

She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission . The raising of the $ 25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration '' held afterward on the campus , were %% reported %% as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles . With the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ; ; Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ; walks laid ; ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent 's home . Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .

report.v | 1 | The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to %% report %% much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview .
report.v | 1 | September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday . After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department %% reported %% Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped .
plant.n | 1 | In recent months , Mr. Dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity . In August , the company took a $ 343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan . The plan calls for closing at least nine %% plants %% and eliminating about 3,600 jobs . But analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in Europe , and there were signs that the board became impatient . Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure .
plant.n | 1 | Brisk domestic demand due to increasing capital investment pushed up sales sharply in construction and industrial machinery divisions . Domestic sales of construction machinery , such as power shovels and bulldozers rose to 142.84 billion yen from 126.15 billion yen . Demand from Europe and Southeast Asia also grew , but due to increasing production at local %% plants %% , overseas sales edged down 2.8 % . Komatsu predicted that for the fiscal year ending March 31 sales will climb to 600 billion yen from 566.54 billion yen ; pretax profit was forecast at 35 billion yen , up from 28.53 billion yen in fiscal 1989 . Net is expected to rise to 17 billion yen from 12.82 billion yen a year earlier .
plant.n | 1 | The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell . He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year . `` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the %% plants %% , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia . USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission . Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati .
plant.n | 1 | The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said . GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich . That means two %% plants %% -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 . The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio . Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
plant.n | 1 | He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits . During Mr. McGovern 's nine-year term as president , the company 's sales rose to $ 5.7 billion from $ 2.8 billion and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million , the statement said . Mr. Baum said he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some %% plants %% as long ago as early 1988 . `` You 've got to make the restructuring work , '' said Mr. Baum . `` You 've got to make those savings now . ''
plant.n | 1 | Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 . Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car %% plants %% in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match . Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
plant.n | 1 | The `` social dimension '' -- worker concerns -- of the European Community 's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort `` off the rails '' if not done reasonably , says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle . U.S. companies wanting to expand in Europe face `` tough pressure '' from unions in nations such as West Germany , which play a big consulting role in management decisions , he says . FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also wo n't like %% plant %% relocations and needed restructuring , which means layoffs . Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy , where wages are low and unions are weaker ; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there , FMC says . Pfizer , Fluor and GE see big `` EC 92 '' pluses : a push for job training and ease in moving and finding workers .
plant.n | 1 | Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents . Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own %% plants %% cover only about half of its ethylene needs . By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year . China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .
plant.n | 1 | A capital-gains tax cut was removed from the Senate 's deficit reduction bill , but proponents still hope to enact the cut this year . Bush wo n't press for a capital-gains provision in the final deficit bill when House-Senate conferees meet later this week . General Motors signaled that up to five North American assembly %% plants %% may close by the mid-1990s as it tries to cut excess capacity . U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6 % in early October , the first sales period of the 1990-model year , dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales . Warner and Sony are entangled in a legal battle over movie producers Peter Gruber and Jon Peters .
plant.n | 1 | `` And then you still have to negotiate . '' Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end . The %% plant %% usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production . Not everything looks grim for Quantum . The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .
plant.n | 1 | However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % . Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier . Honda 's %% plant %% in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said . `` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added . Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .
plant.n | 1 | The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . At the Oklahoma City %% plant %% , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s . At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model .

Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed .

keep.v | 1 | Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . You can %% keep %% your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .
